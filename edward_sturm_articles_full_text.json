    "text": "Four impactful SEO things I learned from my podcast guests this week.\n## 1. Targeting \"your brand + review\" keywords with YouTube and other video platforms.\nKeywords like:\n- Is brand legit?\n- Brand review?\n- Is brand a scam?\n- Does brand really work?\n- Brand 2025 review.\n- Brand worth buying?\n- Brand alternative.\nYouTube, Instagram Reels, Facebook Reels, and TikToks rank extremely well in Google:\nPut up videos on your own channels targeting the keywords above.\nTip came from this podcast a few days ago:\nTake your video testimonials (or read your written testimonials with screenshots), and make videos targeting the above review keywords (brand review, and is brand legit - especially).\nFor me, this was an \"oh snap\" moment. I have many great Compact Keywords video testimonials , but they're all on a video host not meant to rank on Google.\nSo now I'll use them in various ways on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok as I target the above keywords. Everybody should do this.\n## 2. Research report linkable assets still work.\nA linkable asset is something so useful, cool, or interesting that it easily attracts backlinks. Make it, share it in a few key places, and it continues to be shared and get more and more links.\nResearch reports FOR YEARS were a staple linkable asset. But are they played out?\nI had the CMO of Originality.ai, one of the top AI writing detectors, on my podcast yesterday:\nHere's their backlink profile and some of their rankings:\n78,000 backlinks from 7,100 websites.\nTheir method: research report linkable assets.\nThey use their own tool to research how much AI writing is in different industries. For example, how many medical research papers are using AI writing? Oh, it's gone way up over time? Sensational stuff.\nThey do all sorts of interesting research, giving researchers AI detection credits. Then they compile the research, and share it. But how do they share it? How do they get people to distribute it?\n## 3. It's better to cultivate relationships with journalists than to pay a PR agency.\nOne of the mistakes the CMO told me she made was relying on PR agencies for journalist connections. She got way better results when she cultivated the relationships herself.\nAn example - Originality.ai's initial SEO (before the linkable assets) had a journalist from The Guardian find them on Google. The CMO cultivated a relationship with the journalist.\nThrough this relationship, the CMO distributes the research reports and learns what other research would perform well.\n\" I burned so much company money trying to outsource digital PR. It's just one of those initiatives that's so relationship heavy, you cannot replace it by throwing money at it,\" she told me on the podcast.\n## 4. Press releases might work to influence AI... forever\nHarpreet Singh shared how he uses cheap press releases from AB Newswire to influence AI into recommending his brand .\nThis was at the beginning of August.\nThe results have persisted... using the same publication (FinancialContent) that the press release was distributed to months ago:\n(Harpreet's newsletter is SEO Espresso )\nHarpreet and Gagan Ghotra came on my podcast two days ago.\nHarpreet said this, \" I don't think this trick is really going to be weeded out... just because of the way the internet works. LLMs learn from major news sites and their subdomains/subfolders, where press releases are syndicated. While smaller distribution networks can be filtered out, big platforms like PR Newswire or Yahoo News carry legitimate releases from major companies, so AI systems can't realistically exclude them without losing valuable data\"\nHe then followed up by saying the top press release distribution networks will work for competitive keywords.\nAnd by the way, press releases are another method that the CMO of Originality.ai uses for distributing linkable assets.\nPress releases for actual distribution (not AI influencing) work well when the subject matter is both interesting AND in a hot niche. Plain interesting isn't usually enough. You want to relate it to, or have it be in, a niche that is trending (like AI right now).\n## Speaking of influencing AI...\nThis is a testimonial I received yesterday from a customer of my SEO course:\nThe customer is getting dozens of #1 rankings using my method in the course (previously shared in this testimonial ), and now these #1 pages are starting to influence AI Overviews.\nThe method is a different type of SEO. It specifically targets searchers at the bottom of the purchasing funnel; people who know what they want, but who don't know the brand that will give them what they want.\nIt's SEO that brings paying customers vs. cold vanity traffic.\nAnd like I shared in this newsletter, it's getting fantastic testimonials, which you can see on the landing page... here -> https://edwardsturm.com/compact-keywords/"

    "text": "Today's episode of my daily podcast is 830 - 830 days in a row doing this podcast.\nRight now I'm getting 8-10x as many daily views as I was a year ago.\nA year ago I was getting 8-10x more daily views than the year before that.\nThese are all the changes to the show I've made since starting.\nJuly 12, 2023: Started The Edward Show.\nAt the very beginning, the show was audio only, not edited, stream of consciousness, me-only ranting about a variety of topics in life, business, and marketing.\n- Early August, 2023: Started using the Descript editing app. I previously wrote about how big a difference this app made on my short-form videos. With my long-form podcast, it allowed me to tighten episodes by easily removing long gaps and areas where I was trying to figure out what to say.\n- Mid-late August, 2023: Covered a viral topic ( the TwitterX Ads Glitch I discovered ) that my growing TikTok audience (I hadn't yet cracked Instagram) wanted more detail on. The episode got a few thousand listeners. A tiny fraction of those listeners became repeat listeners.\n- Early November, 2023: Added captions to the episodes. Helped a bit with retention as my podcast was still audio-only.\n- Mid February, 2024: Started recording with video at the suggestion of my friend, Avni Barman . When I first started doing the podcast with video I was super self-conscious and nervous - which is why it took so long in the first place.\n- Late May, 2024: Stopped using captions in my videos. Captions were a huge time drain. Descript's automatic transcriptions have major errors and I was spending a lot of time correcting them. By not doing captions I made it less intimidating for me to do long episodes. I also freed up time for more important things (written below). Turned out captions also only provided a very minimal retention increase, too.\n- Late May, 2024: Was one of the first to cover Google's Algorithm Leak , Google's biggest leak ever. The removal of captions right before was good timing - this Algorithm Leak episode was 34 minutes and I was okay with doing it because I knew I wouldn't have to correct captions. By being one of the first to cover this topic, I got a ton of views (as you can see from the graph) and like with #2, a small fraction turned into repeat viewers.\n- Mid January, 2025: Released Compact Keywords, my SEO course, so I had more bandwidth to dedicate to the podcast. This is notable because it took a year to make Compact Keywords.\n- Mid January, 2025: Routinely started having guests on the podcast. I was waiting until the release of Compact Keywords to do this, as guest episodes were more work (at the time) than normal episodes.\n- Mid February, 2025: Hired a thumbnail designer.\n- Mid March, 2025: Covered another viral topic in SEO, the March Core Algorithm Update . This time a MUCH higher fraction of viewers turned into repeat viewers - for two reasons...\n- Mid March, 2025: Reason 1 - I started putting more work into episodes (more images and better topics). Whereas for the past year and a half I tried getting viewers with gimmicks (recording on rooftops, high energy, captions, silly backgrounds), this time I tried getting viewers with better topics and more relevant images that made the topics make more sense. In retrospect, it was so obvious.\n- Mid March, 2025: Reason 2 - I niched down to just SEO content. At this point the podcast had narrowed from life, business, and marketing to just marketing... but now I narrowed it down even further, to just SEO. I was reluctant to do this because I like talking about a variety of topics.\n- Late May, 2025: I hired a part-time editor to take my spot putting in images and cleaning up sloppy cuts. This allowed me to focus more on good topics with more research and preparation. Right after hiring this editor, I covered a surprisingly viral SEO topic .\n- Mid June, 2025: I started letting ChatGPT write 90% of my podcast titles. This improved CTR a substantial amount, while also saving me time.\n- Early July, 2025: I started having ChatGPT write 90% of my podcast descriptions (while still reviewing/editing the AI output myself). Long SEO'd descriptions were always a consideration, but letting ChatGPT do it saved time.\n## On the horizon\nRight now I'm hiring a full-time editor.\nIt's taking way longer than I thought it would take. It's stressful. I'm being extremely picky and have hundreds of applicants to sort through.\nBut when I look back on this moment a year from now, this will likely be my next big change and improvement.\nAnd then there will be more after that.\nStill on my to-do list:\n- More graphics for solo podcasts.\n- Trailers at beginnings of guest episodes.\n- Researcher for episodes.\n- Producer to do all the non-speaking work I'm still doing, such as uploading, refining descriptions, managing my thumbnail designer and editor.\nBut one thing at a time.\nMost people see starting and not succeeding the first month(s) as failing. I see it for what it is - starting. Just starting. You're starting and you improve over time.\n## By the way\nPart of the reason I spent so long on Compact Keywords, my SEO course, is I wanted to give viewers and listeners a durable system for doing SEO. Something that would continue to work for years despite constant algorithm updates and new trends.\nThe best SEO isn't churn and burn tactics. It's well structured websites, landing pages and blogs that make sense, and strategic keyword targeting. That's what Compact Keywords teaches.\nThe method works so well that the pages I created in 2019 with the method still rank #1 for their target keywords.\nAnd like my podcast growth, this method isn't due to silly gimmicks, it's a handful of best practices that actually attract long-term customers, rather than simply vanity traffic.\nThese are practices that will immediately make sense. But with so many confusing viral gimmicks floating around X, YouTube, and LinkedIn, people don't know what to focus on.\nAgain - this is what to actually focus on.\nCompact Keywords is available at compactkeywords.com"

    "text": "Sora 2 just released and I'm nearly as amazed and obsessed with it as I was with ChatGPT when it first launched in December of 2022.\nIf you're already on Sora 2, my handle is @edwardsturm , and my cameos are open.\nIf you're not on it, don't worry, you'll likely get an invite soon, or you'll just get an invite through your ChatGPT account.\nI believe that, similar to ChatGPT, Sora 2 is a fleeting opportunity for above average visibility.\nMost people now can quickly spot ChatGPT writing, but that was not the case when it was released. Students turned in papers written entirely by ChatGPT and got A's, marketers sent fully ChatGPT-written newsletters impressing their readers, I posted fully ChatGPT-written Reddit threads promoting my brand and had the threads go viral...\nOf course, none of this would work now, but Q1 and Q2 of 2023... it worked great.\nI suspect Sora 2 will be the same. So in this article, I will share:\nTwo more things that could make this a fleeting opportunity. At the time of writing, Sora 2 is:\n- Completely free.\n- Gives unlimited generations with no quantity constraints.\n## My results with Sora 2\nSo far I've made 3 videos with Sora 2. The performance for all videos has been above average.\nBelow are the total view counts across platforms:\n- https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPW5dIxDMmR/ - 431,000 views Sora 2 for the hook. If you're into SEO, this one is extra cool, by the way. Use this to see the language ChatGPT searches the web with - then take this language and use it in your content to increase coverage across LLMs.\n- Sora 2 for the hook.\n- If you're into SEO, this one is extra cool, by the way. Use this to see the language ChatGPT searches the web with - then take this language and use it in your content to increase coverage across LLMs.\n- https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPUXLvzDCcF/ - 141,000 views Sora 2 for the hook and the ending.\n- Sora 2 for the hook and the ending.\n- https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPYwq7WjMUL/ - 29,000 views Sora 2 for the hook. This one was a flop, but my flops typically receive way less views than this, so the Sora 2 hook made even the flop perform above average.\n- Sora 2 for the hook.\n- This one was a flop, but my flops typically receive way less views than this, so the Sora 2 hook made even the flop perform above average.\n## How to get around some protections within Sora 2\nFirst, Sora 2 works outside the United States with a VPN. I'm traveling through Europe and accessing Sora 2, without problems using NordVPN.\nSecond, when you do cameos with Sora 2 - using other people's looks in your videos - Sora 2 doesn't let you download the videos. I'm using this Chrome extension to get around that. I have no affiliation with that extension; I use it to download my cameo videos for content. Works perfectly.\n## How I'm using Sora 2 for content\nIf you haven't tried Sora 2, it's incredible how simple it is. Unlike other AI tools, you don't need long complex prompts. Here are a few of mine:\nOne of my close friends is Head of Video at the New York Post. This is what he texted me about Sora 2:\nSora 2's writing really is spectacular. It's comedic and it's sophisticated. It's certainly not flawless, but it often gets things right on the first try.\nIt's also mind-numbingly easy to train the AI on your face. Takes literally one minute. You just follow the directions, \"Say these numbers... tilt your head this way... tilt your head that way...\" then you're done. And if you don't like the output, you can retrain Sora 2 on your face whenever you want.\nRight now I'm mostly using Sora 2 for hooks. Think of a good verbal hook , then use Sora 2 to put yourself in a more illustrative location.\n\"Nobody knows this about Google,\" - great verbal hook... but even better when said in the Google offices with the Google logo everywhere.\nOr, like I did in a previous example, showing a ChatGPT SEO hack, with Sam Altman (who has his cameo open to everybody) in the hook.\nHow about the Sora watermark on the video? Nobody even notices! I had several people share with me they didn't even notice. Insane.\nWant easy views? Let's say you're keeping a log of evergreen subject matter ... Sora 2 for the hook, then rerecord the subject matter. You can do this MANY times with different cool Sora hooks before it gets boring.\nSomething else I'm working on - stringing together Sora 2 videos. I found this yesterday - no idea who created it:\nNow I'm making myself give a TED Talk, saying this on stage.\nLast thing that's remarkable. You can give custom prompts for how you appear in cameos:\nI just turned that off, but with it on, any video with me automatically had me talking about search engine optimization. My prompt for this video is \"@edwardsturm walking through hawaii\" but because of the custom instructions, I was relating the tide to search engine optimization.\nSo you can control how your brand appears in others' videos.\n## Future predictions with Sora 2-type tech\nAgain, we're in this sweet spot in which this content is still not widely-adopted, making it stand out.\nI believe Meta, with all its face data and social graph data, will roll out a feature like this to Instagram and it will dominate Sora 2.\nThe bad news here is everybody will try it and this AI video content will get a lot more stale.\nThe good news is with Sora 2, we'll already have a lot of practice knowing what works, what doesn't, and prompts to use. But I think a Meta rollout of this tech is on the horizon.\nSo right now Sora 2 is a crazy opportunity to get your brand in front of more eyeballs and it is not yet played out. I hope you'll try it.\nFeel free to cameo me with @edwardsturm .\n## One more thing\nLots of people asked why I have a bandage in my podcast and videos... and it's not what you think.\nI had basal cell carcinoma removed last Monday, got a few stitches; they come out in a week.\nBut still keeping my streak with content.\n823 days in a row with the podcast.\n1070 days in a row making social videos.\nLet's go!\nAnd for more results-oriented marketing... -> my SEO course showing how to get paying customers with SEO: https://compactkeywords.com/"

    "text": "Sometimes it's just nice to hear these things are possible...\nThis guy , in six months, went from 2,000 followers on LinkedIn, to 33,000 - and $0 ARR to $1,000,000... with virtually no customer acquisition cost:\nFunny enough this was my worst performing podcast this week, but I thought it was one of my more insightful ones.\nIf you don't want to watch the whole thing, below are my takeaways:\n- Amos, my guest, uses Claude to write his high-performing LinkedIn posts. He's found hard numbers and facts, subject matter about automating workflows and employees, and current events do especially well.\n- He has a Project in Claude where he has a ton of documentation about the types of hooks he wants, subject matter he wants, copy he wants, facts he wants, his personal journal, his business, and more. Claude, when it generates a LinkedIn post, uses this Project documentation as a high-level prompt. Two days before Amos, I had on Nico from AI Ranking on the podcast. Similarly, Nico said Projects in ChatGPT (essentially the same thing as Claude), \" is the most underrated thing in the world .\"\n- Two days before Amos, I had on Nico from AI Ranking on the podcast. Similarly, Nico said Projects in ChatGPT (essentially the same thing as Claude), \" is the most underrated thing in the world .\"\n- Amos doesn't have Claude write the LinkedIn posts without human guidance. He spends 30-60 minutes on each post, guiding it section by section. Nico, who automates SEO blog posts and pages, said the same thing: \" It's more effective to have AI write section by section, rather than writing the whole thing in one shot .\"\n- Nico, who automates SEO blog posts and pages, said the same thing: \" It's more effective to have AI write section by section, rather than writing the whole thing in one shot .\"\n- Amos only puts up 3-4 posts per week. More would be even better, but the inbound he gets is so crazy he doesn't have time for more.\n- He uses AIs within Slack to qualify and filter leads . He then responds to the most high-value ones manually. The $1,000,000 ARR is from only 200 customers, but high-value ones. His business is an AI GTM automation, Swan .\n- He has a team of just three people - him and two others. He believes he can get to $10,000,000 ARR per employee .\n- Instead of mindlessly scaling AI slop, he spends an above-average amount of time fine-tuning a system, figuring out what works, and then automating.\n## For fun\nI wanted to see if I could reverse engineer Amos's LinkedIn posts.\nI took a few high-performing posts, gave them to ChatGPT, and had ChatGPT write a prompt to come up with similar posts.\nAs I already wrote, it would be more effective to go section-by-section, but as a start you can try this for fun:\nWhen you try this, just make sure you review the output for accuracy, and edit where needed to make the writing more human .\n## It's possible\nRemarkable things are possible in digital marketing all the time if you have the right underlying strategy.\nFor those interested in SEO, this is what my course, Compact Keywords, provides:\nThe underlying strategy to do SEO that gets sales, users, customers, etc - even if you're a new site or startup.\nThe strategy is used by hundreds of businesses - small, mid-sized, and even enterprise.\nLike Amos's LinkedIn method, Compact Keywords is an underlying repeatable strategy for meaningful growth. But instead of organic LinkedIn growth, Compact Keywords is for organic growth on Google Search and LLMs - targeting keywords that bring revenue.\nSome of the things customers are saying:\n\"Within the first week and a half, I made over $1,200 just from the backlink section; how to get posts, press releases, and expert quotes.\" - Zack Tokar\n\"Booked about $100,000 of business through SEO in my first year with the Compact Keywords method.\" - Robert Brill\n\"I'm now ranking #1 on Google for 25+ keywords and hundreds on Bing - with a new site - after starting Compact Keywords only two months ago. Everyone needs to take this. You will see results you can't even comprehend.\" - Jacob Darrah\n\"Now I have more than 20 pages ranking #1 and #2 for my company.\" - Alejandro Morelli\n\"Compact Keywords was able to pay for itself in about a month and nine days.\" - Angel Olavarria\n\"These pages drove an extra $3 million in revenue from organic search over the following year. I'm not an SEO, I focus on PPC, but helped implement this strategy for a market leader (in a finance niche).\" - Dominick DeJoy\nGet Compact Keywords for your business at https://edwardsturm.com/compact-keywords/"

Remarkably, Facebook and Instagram even have identical descriptions (whereas YouTube has a slightly different title).\nI want to say - I'm not doing this to \"game Google\" or \"outsmart Google.\" Reposting content across platforms is a MUST today. You have to do it to win and there are smart repurposing strategies that save time - here's mine .\nBut people gravitate towards user-generated content, so Google prioritizes it. UGC tends to be more engaging, to the point, and authentic than an SEO article or page.\nAnd from what I'm seeing, this is only going to intensify next year.\nFacebook moved from #5 to #4, TikTok rose from #11 to #8 and Instagram rose by one point to #6. Source .\nSo I'm calling it now. Here's the 2026 SEO playbook:\n- As you're targeting keywords with pages and posts on your website, you're also making short videos on the subject matter, targeting THE SAME KEYWORD.\n- You're making the videos fast and casually. Example 1 . Example 2 . Example 3 . Each of those high-performing videos took a few minutes total with ideation, recording, editing, posting.\n- You're now targeting one keyword with a single page/post and MULTIPLE videos.\n- Each video releases to every platform, following this method .\n- This is giving you maximum coverage on the keyword.\n- The keyword is always positioned at the beginning of your content title/description. You're taking your video transcript and using it as the rest of the description.\n- When your page/post is published on your website, the UGC also links back to it. Links in Instagram and TikTok descriptions are not clickable but links in Facebook Reels and YouTube descriptions ARE clickable. Google just admitted ' the open web is in rapid decline .' Google needs more link signals. Links from video descriptions, especially links that get clicks, are valuable.\nEvery SEO that has come on my podcast over the last couple of months has said the same thing: \"diversify your content.\"\nMost SEOs stay in silos. But the way to win in 2026 will be to maximize coverage. Start now.\n## Go deeper\nIf you want to go deeper on hitting purchase-intent keywords with videos and UGC, my SEO course, Compact Keywords, has an entire section dedicated to it: \"Ranking Without Using a Website\"\nThe course is getting insane results for customers - you can see video testimonials and learn about the course here: https://edwardsturm.com/compact-keywords/"

Subject matter.\n## You get promoted\nTo finish with the beginning quote...\nIt's the same on X. It's the same on Instagram. It's the same on TikTok. It's the same on YouTube. It's the same on Threads. It's the same on LinkedIn. It's the same with SEO.\nDo this every day for 6 months.\nIf you stick to it, we will promote your account to others.\nBy the end, you will be recognized as the world's leading expert in that subject area and you can charge whatever you want for endorsements, your time, or whatever. And no one will be able to take that away from you.\n## Bottom-of-Funnel SEO\nIf you want to learn how to make those bottom-of-funnel SEO landing pages designed to bring customers, users, warm leads for whatever it is you're selling... products, services, SaaS, anything...\nMy SEO course, Compact Keywords, is exactly about this.\nHere's another video testimonial I received this week .\nNow I have more than 20 pages ranking #1 and 2 for my company.\nBefore Compact Keywords, I wasted thousands of dollars on SEO courses, trainings, and wasted time reading blogs. Compact Keywords is best training you're going to find. It's updated. And it's working now, in 2025, in the AI era.\nTo me, Compact Keywords is not a course. It's your method. It's your blueprint. It's the system you need to rank a website.\nFor more results-driven video testimonials just like this, visit the Compact Keywords landing page: https://edwardsturm.com/compact-keywords/"

    "text": "People are using this to rank their brands and some bottom of funnel keywords on Google in hours to just a few days.\nAnd it takes only a few minutes to make the content.\nClaude Artifacts (documents - code, articles, guides, anything Claude can generate) are ranking on Google when clicking Publish on the Artifact.\nI'm not sure how much longer this will last, but since people aren't freaking out over privacy like what happened with ChatGPT shared chats , it could last a bit longer.\nHere's how it works.\n- Copy your whole landing page into Claude. Give it keywords you want it to use. Tell it to make an article for why your brand is great, reputable, trustworthy, etc. Hopefully you have all this supporting information on your landing page.\n- It will draft the article as an Artifact.\n- Click Publish.\nYou're done, lol.\nYou can even have Claude make full styled pages as Artifacts, not just articles.\nI learned this trick from Jesper Nissen who reported on it here .\nJesper has a tool called SchemaWriter.ai.\nWhen you Google, \"how to use schemawriter\"\nHis Claude Artifact is cited in the AI Overview and is high on the first page of Google (below his YouTube videos on it).\nPerplexity cites Claude Artifacts as well.\nChatGPT, however, does not. In fact - with my tests, I could not get ChatGPT to cite Claude Artifacts.\nHowever - I had ChatGPT make full landing page copy for a fictional brand of coffee called Serenity Caffeine, coffee to ease headaches. I gave this landing page copy to Claude and had it make this published article .\nVoila:\n## But\nSome people are saying they have to use black hat paid indexing services to force Google to index these Artifacts.\nThis is a common one.\nThis is a Reddit discussion about these tools. The overwhelming consensus was don't use these black hat paid indexing services on your own site - which I agree with. If you want something indexed on your own site, most of the time submitting it to Google Search Console and doing white hat link building is good enough.\nBut for a URL to a Claude Artifact, there's little risk.\n## More\nAnd it looks like these Artifacts work for low-competition keywords. You can tell Claude what you want for the H1, Page Title, and more.\nIf you do a simple article, like what I did with Serenity Caffeine , the H1 is automatically the Page Title. And it is VERY important to have your target keyword at the beginning of the Page Title and H1.\nSo by doing this, Claude also ranks for non-branded low-competition keywords. Crazy.\n## Get customers with SEO\nMy SEO course has been getting raving testimonials, like this video testimonial a few nights ago:\n\"I'm now ranking #1 on Google for 25+ keywords and hundreds on Bing - with a new site - after starting Compact Keywords only two months ago. Everyone needs to take this. You will see results you can't even comprehend.\"\nOr this video testimonial :\n\"Within the first week and a half, I made over $1,200 just from the backlink section, how to get posts, press releases, and expert quotes.\nI've also used it for landing pages, and Edward's there to help you and to explain things. I can't recommend it highly enough.\"\nCompact Keywords is about getting paying customers, getting users, getting warm leads - with conversion-based SEO landing pages - not blog content. It's a different type of page structure, site structure, and keyword research method.\nIt's my exact strategy of SEO (including link building and video SEO).\nAnd the course is made to be thorough enough for you to implement yourself or for your staff to implement.\nI'm a bit biased, just a little bit, but I believe Compact Keywords is the best SEO course of all time. (In all seriousness, it might actually be).\nYou can get it here: https://edwardsturm.com/ compact-keywords/"

    "text": "Content refreshes are commonly named the greatest SEO hack by many SEOs.\nI've been doing a bunch of them lately, so I want to share why they're so good, and some common tactics for refreshing SEO content.\n#### Jump Ahead\n## Why content refreshes are incredible\nThe difference in click-through rate for ranking #1 and #2 on Google is insane .\nPosition 1 CTR: 39.8% Position 2 CTR: 18.7%\nThis means pages ranking #1 get more than double the traffic as #2.\nGoing even lower:\nPosition 3 CTR: 10.2% Position 4 CTR: 7.4%\nYou would MUCH rather have a few excellent SEO pages ranking #1 than many mediocre ones not ranking #1.\nContent refreshes make you a lot more likely to have these excellent pages. Here's why, in order of importance:\n- You're able to evaluate your content with fresh eyes. \" Every now and then go away, have a little relaxation, for when you come back to your work your judgment will be surer. Go some distance away because then the work appears smaller and more of it can be taken in at a glance and a lack of harmony and proportion is more readily seen. \" - Leonardo da Vinci The first draft is usually the worst draft. Common issues you may notice: Awkward keyword targeting. Takes too long to get to the meat of the page. The images aren't related to the content. The writing is boring. The page is UGLY. The page is slow. The keyword isn't in the key places (for example, the page title). The intent was misjudged. Sources weren't cited. You didn't interlink to the content; the page is orphaned. You accidentally noindexed the page. No OG image. The page title doesn't stand out from competitor page titles. The URL slug is a random string. The list goes on...\n- \" Every now and then go away, have a little relaxation, for when you come back to your work your judgment will be surer.

And because the rewards of ranking #1 above #2-4+ are so great (over double the traffic), it's worth it.\n## Common ways to do content refreshes\nThe #1 way to do a content refresh is to review the above-the-fold content of your page (what people see before they start scrolling), then look at what is right below.\nAside from the page title, this is the first thing SEO visitors will see and it is your one opportunity to hook readers.\nThis area is the Pareto of a content refresh - it's the 20% that gets 80% of the results.\nAsk yourself:\n- Is it clear that this page is for your target audience?\n- Do you give visitors what they want fast enough or is it so slow that they may bounce? One of my favorite Reddit posts of all time - this person added Too Long; Didn't Reads to the top of their pages, which boosted conversions by 33% . I made this recent podcast about how images above-the-fold could actually hurt your SEO if used improperly.\n- One of my favorite Reddit posts of all time - this person added Too Long; Didn't Reads to the top of their pages, which boosted conversions by 33% .\n- I made this recent podcast about how images above-the-fold could actually hurt your SEO if used improperly.\n- Are you clear in your writing?\n- Are you too wordy?\n- Are there obvious reasons visitors may not trust this content?\nNext, look at your keywords:\n- Are you using the target keyword in the page title, meta description, URL slug, H1, and beginning of the first sentence?\n- Is Google Search Console showing other keywords you should work into the content? Go to Performance > Search results > Pages > Click a page > Queries shows all the keywords the page is ranking for. This data is showing you the language for your topic that people actually use. By simply using some of these keywords on your page, you may be able to rank very high for them - while also improving your page for readers.\n- Is your keyword targeting forced or awkward? Are you using keywords that are unnatural fragments (which you shouldn't do).\nLook at the rest of your content - is anything out of date? It might be very little work to make your page completely up-to-date - and this is something that is very important.\nTry to get even more data. Microsoft Clarity gives you heatmaps, scroll maps, and click maps for free. With it, I saw that visitors to my SEO course, Compact Keywords , were spending A LOT of time looking at testimonials. So you know what I did? I increased the font size of the testimonials and moved some of them up to the top of the page - right after the above-the-fold - and conversions increased.\nAre there any new SEO tactics you can work in? Lately I've become obsessed with interactive comprehension quizzes that also recommend my products or similar articles at the end.\nFor example, this quiz:\nHere's how to make these quizzes:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7367003984282157056/\nOnce you have refreshed the content, make sure to submit the URL to Google Search Console , so Google will crawl it. And if you made many changes, update the date published to now.\nAgain, the difference between ranking #1 and anything below it is huge. So you'd rather have a few excellent pages, than many mediocre ones.\nNext time you're considering creating a new SEO page, ask yourself, \"Is there anything I can refresh?\"\n## Become more efficient with SEO\nContent refreshes are great because they're efficient. You get better results by improving what's already there instead of starting from scratch.\nBut if you want the most efficient SEO, the best way is pages built for people ready to buy now vs. later.\nInstead of making content for cold or lukewarm people - go directly to where people are looking to spend money on what you offer.\nThis is exactly what my course, Compact Keywords, teaches.\nYou may be spending years learning SEO and focusing on the things that don't get results . Compact Keywords is about what actually drives revenue.\nCompact Keywords is getting raving testimonials, it's detailed enough for anybody to implement, and it just works.\nZack Tokar\nWilliam Bremer\nAngel Olavarria\nGet Compact Keywords here: https://edwardsturm.com/compact-keywords/\n## More on content refreshes"

    "text": "This is a step-by-step checklist for how to humanize ChatGPT content.\nA few weeks ago I made a podcast on this. A lot of people were really into it, so I thought I'd turn it into a written process here.\nThe truth is, I hate most AI-written content.\nBut when done properly, it's hard or impossible to tell, and can save a ton of time and mental energy that you can put towards other tasks.\n## What I use AI writing for\n- Turning my podcast transcripts into: LinkedIn posts promoting the podcasts Podcast titles YouTube descriptions X threads\n- LinkedIn posts promoting the podcasts\n- Podcast titles\n- YouTube descriptions\n- X threads\n- Listing product benefits - ChatGPT is especially good at doing this in a concise human-enough sounding way\n- Checking over long emails\n## What I don't use AI writing for\nThe biggest things I don't use AI writing for:\n- Entire newsletters\n- Entire emails\n- Messages\n- Entire landing pages\n- Video scripts\nWhy:\n- Long-form, AI writing is more identifiable. For a lot of people this kills trust, which then: Hurts retention. Hurts return rate. Increases bounce rate.\n- For a lot of people this kills trust, which then: Hurts retention. Hurts return rate. Increases bounce rate.\n- Hurts retention.\n- Hurts return rate.\n- Increases bounce rate.\n- As AI writing becomes more common, a premium is being put on human communication.\n- AI can only write with the data it's trained off of and the prompts it's given. A lot of what I say is contrarian enough AI can't articulate it from the get go and even with prompting, takes a lot of work to get right. So it's faster for me to write a draft and then use AI to help refine.\n## How I humanize my ChatGPT output\n- Use GPT-5. This is the best model from my experience for sounding human.\n- Replace all em dashes (-) with space, normal dash, space ( - ). Em dashes used to be great but ChatGPT's nonstop usage triggers people into suspecting AI, even if not AI-written.\n- Em dashes used to be great but ChatGPT's nonstop usage triggers people into suspecting AI, even if not AI-written.\n- Remove excessive buzzwords and excessive emojis. Simply try this prompt on output you receive, \"Use less buzzwords and emojis.\" This is a good list of common ChatGPT buzzwords:\n- This is a good list of common ChatGPT buzzwords:\n- Add images and videos specific to your content. Examples: Screenshots/screen recordings Extremely related YouTube videos Images and videos that are harder to generate are better BUT anything is better than nothing.

The one thing is if you're using AI-generated text, avoid obviously AI-generated images.\n- Examples: Screenshots/screen recordings Extremely related YouTube videos\n- Screenshots/screen recordings\n- Extremely related YouTube videos\n- Images and videos that are harder to generate are better BUT anything is better than nothing.

The podcast comes out to YouTube, Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Audible. Give me a good title for the podcast episode. Transcript:\"\nMy editing tool automatically generates a transcript so I'm able to paste that in directly.\nYou can also paste in entire articles to turn into X threads or interesting LinkedIn posts. Instruct ChatGPT to start with a clickbait opening then refine your output by having it remove buzzwords and emojis. Be generous adding in multimedia (which ChatGPT can also help you find).\nTons of people are using these strategies to go viral, increase conversions, do SEO, and save time. I hope you'll be one of them.\n## Can you spot and fix AI-sounding text?\nTake the quiz to find out.\n## The podcast that inspired this article\n## SEO\nYou can also use this technique to help create bottom-of-funnel SEO landing pages that sell .\nWhen you learn how to make these pages, it becomes easy to incorporate human-sounding AI writing to save time.\nIf you'd like to learn how to do SEO from the ground up - specifically SEO that targets people looking to purchase now - I have a 13+ hour course on it here ."

I explained:\n- The curious learner bias. If you learn something and consistently talk about what you're learning, people will come to see you as an expert, even though you're merely a curious learner. This is because consistency creates top-of-mind awareness for your niche.\n- I believe Formula 1 is both: Hot and trendy. Events have become a billionaire meeting spot . Penetrable. Its rising popularity times well with the popularity of short-form mobile video like TikTok and Instagram Reels.\n- Hot and trendy. Events have become a billionaire meeting spot .\n- Penetrable. Its rising popularity times well with the popularity of short-form mobile video like TikTok and Instagram Reels.\nI said on the podcast, not expecting anybody to do this, if you make daily videos about what you're learning in Formula 1 and you don't miss a day, I will mentor you.\nTo my surprise, 3 people started doing this, and @coop_formula has taken off.\nQuick breakdown:\n- Coop didn't know anything about Formula 1 three weeks ago when the account was started.\n- He manually posted at least one Instagram Reel daily to this new account. These videos come out everywhere: TikTok, YouTube Shorts, etc. Instagram growth has been the fastest.\n- He has a lot of content experience and deserves credit for that.\n- A quote from him: \"I've been in marketing and have built a number of accounts to 20k+, but this is the fastest it's gone viral.\"\n## How a friend with a new dating Instagram got to 18,000 followers in five weeks.\nThe account: https://www.instagram.com/junyuanofficial/reels/\nJunyuan's content:\n- He's a male model who dresses well, usually in a suit.\n- He playfully interviews attractive women about their dating lives.\n- Before posting to Instagram, he was putting his videos on TikTok, where they were doing well. Most videos got in the tens of thousands of views. Many got hundreds of thousands. A solid handful got millions.\n- Junyuan only began posting Reels 5 weeks ago.\nJunyuan makes many videos from London and Sweden. Here's a fun quote from him: \"I was out in Central London yesterday. I kept getting recognized. I'm also recognized nonstop in Stockholm.\" In fact, he was even recording at one point when somebody came up to him asking for a picture.\n## What these accounts have in common.\nIt would be easy to discount these accounts' success by saying, \"They make good videos, duh.\" And, absolutely, it takes patience and practice to get good at making content.\nHowever, there are still critical posting and content patterns that both accounts share.\nThese patterns are often overlooked because they are so simple. In fact, I had been overlooking these up until just this week. Here are the patterns:\n- Both accounts stick rigidly to their niches.\n- Both accounts post their Instagram Reels manually (without 3rd party automation tools or scheduling tools).\n- Both accounts post daily.\n- Both accounts produce videos daily (not batch record).\nSimple, right? The important thing is if you do this and you have some content-making experience, you can get similar results .\n## Why not batch record?\nEvery day that you post, you're offered valuable lessons and insights into what works and what doesn't.\nBy batch recording (for example, recording 30 videos at the beginning of each month and uploading one per day), you don't take advantage of these lessons and insights.\nYou may still iterate (improve) off some lessons, but you won't iterate off all of them. Then you'll have to wait until the next batch recording date to try again.\nImprovement will be slow. Views will decrease because your audience will get bored. You'll get demoralized. You'll give up.\nBy shooting and editing each day, it's much easier to improve your videos and grow fast.\n## How often some of the biggest accounts are posting and what they're posting.\nI wanted to see if there was a best practice for posting frequency on Instagram. I looked at several content-based accounts. Here's what I saw:\n@Hormozi (Alex Hormozi):\n- 4 million followers.\n- Posts 1-2 Reels daily in addition to pictures.\n@Garyvee (Gary Vaynerchuk):\n- 10.8 million followers.\n- Posts 1 Reel daily in addition to pictures.\n@Dailystoic (Ryan Holiday):\n- 3.4 million followers.\n- Posts 4-5 Reels weekly, but posts 1-2 pictures a day.\n## How exactly I'll be using this knowledge on my own Instagram (feel free to copy me).\nThere are so many nuances when it comes to posting Instagram Reels.\nSo, I will start with the high-level things I'll be doing.\nThen, I'm going to have a breakout section for nuances.\nIf you're not active growing a brand on Instagram, the nuances will not be meaningful. If you are active, these nuances will be very valuable.\nOverview of what I'm doing:\n- Shooting and editing daily.\n- Manually posting 1-3 Reels daily in my niche. These can be brand-new Reels or viral Reels, which I have not posted in months.\n- These can be brand-new Reels or viral Reels, which I have not posted in months.\n- Using a 3rd party tool to repost 1-3 previous Reels daily.\n- Shoutout to my friend Avni for the above strategy. She's growing by 300-500 followers a day through this. Also, here's a quote from Avni that I love about what content to make: \"I do think storytelling content about yourself is hard to make go viral, but it converts to followers at a far higher conversion rate.\"\n- Also, here's a quote from Avni that I love about what content to make: \"I do think storytelling content about yourself is hard to make go viral, but it converts to followers at a far higher conversion rate.\"\nNuances ( skip over this if you're not yet consistent on Instagram ):\n- Manually posting through the Instagram app shows Reels to existing followers. Previously, Instagram had an option to toggle this off. This option has been removed.\n- With a 3rd party tool ( I use this one ) you can still have Reels go only to people who are not following you.\n- My workflow is my videos come out on TikTok first. Then, they come out to every other platform automatically through the above 3rd party tool.\n- Manual posting on a 3rd party tool vs. automatic posting on a 3rd party tool. I've tested several tools, and the results are always the same. For Instagram only, if the tool is set to publish automatically, performance on Instagram is near to nonexistent. However, if published manually through the tool, the results seem to be dramatically better. I'm still testing this.\n- I've tested several tools, and the results are always the same.\n- For Instagram only, if the tool is set to publish automatically, performance on Instagram is near to nonexistent.\n- However, if published manually through the tool, the results seem to be dramatically better. I'm still testing this.\n- High-level consequences of these nuances: My brand is pushed out to new people who can then follow me. Existing followers are given daily Reels that increase top-of-mind awareness. These Reels also show to more non-followers. I wrote that Instagram recently removed the option to manually post through the app and only show to new followers. This old feature had the added benefit of always - without exception - pushing my videos out to hundreds of thousands or millions of viewers. It was dramatic . If manual posting through a 3rd party tool replaces this lost functionality, it will be wildly beneficial.\n- My brand is pushed out to new people who can then follow me.\n- Existing followers are given daily Reels that increase top-of-mind awareness.

If manual posting through a 3rd party tool replaces this lost functionality, it will be wildly beneficial.\n## How you can use this knowledge.\nIf you have a non-content-based brand (an app, a cafe, a services company, etc.) and you want to get customers through Instagram, the simplest thing to do is manually, through the Instagram app, post 1 Reel a day within your niche to the grid.\nThe Empire State Building Instagram is a good example of a non-content-based brand doing organic Instagram marketing well. The account posts at least 4 Reels a week.\nIf you have or want to start a content-based brand on Instagram with which to monetize , simply produce and post 1 Reel a day within your niche. Quality will improve with practice; it always does. You can use these things I learned to jump-start your quality.\nOnce you develop a content library, you can incorporate the nuances and repost previous videos through a 3rd party tool or without.\nFor me and many others, Instagram is one of the best acquisition channels.\nIf it's not already, by doing what's shared in this article, it will become one for you, too.\n## Are you ready to start growing on Instagram?\nTest yourself with the quiz below."

    "text": "Seven cool SEO experiments, case studies, and lessons learned - written as concisely as possible - with supporting videos/articles.\n#### Jump Ahead\n## Manipulating LLMs: AI Overviews, ChatGPT, & Perplexity\nBranded searches and non-competitive searches on Google's AI Overviews, ChatGPT, and Perplexity can be influenced by cheap press releases.\nWay it works:\n- Write your press release anonymously or under a pseudonym. The press release says how you are a great brand for xyz, you're top rated, 5/5 stars, etc.\n- Distribute it through Fiverr or SEO Clerks .\n- Google sees the same language occurring in several places and synthesizes it into an AI Overview.\n- LLMs pull information from Google's indexed content, surfacing and citing the press release.\n- People considering the brand will search it on Google or LLMs. The AI Overview and LLMs say how you are a great brand for xyz, you're top rated, 5/5 stars, etc. Credibility is signaled. Sales cycles are shortened.\n- Similarly, AI parrots what you want for other non-competitive searches.\nWhole podcast on this here:\nSeems like people are also doing this with competitor brand names!\n## 404 Pages\nSeems basic, but Google recently stated you should not redirect 404 pages to the homepage - you need to have a dedicated 404 page.\nThis is what a lot of 404 pages look like:\nI started thinking, \"How can I make this better?\"\nI put in a gif of myself, useful links, and a CTA for my newsletter:\nSuch a fun, easy thing to do that people overlook.\n## Dead Meetup Backlinks\nThis one is cool because it expands your marketing footprint beyond just SEO.\nEvery day, a meetup on Meetup.com that somebody took months or years to build is abandoned .\nMeetup.com charges to have a meetup over 50 people. Organizers get bored, decide they don't want to pay the annual fee, and abandon their meetups.\nWhen this happens, everybody in the group gets notified that the organizer is \"stepping down,\" and you can take it over with a button click.\nYou join related meetups and set up an email filter to only be notified of Meetup.com emails containing \"shut down\" or \"stepping down.\"\nWhen opportunity comes, you take it over.\nYou then have a VA cold email upcoming events in your niche saying you want to send your members to their events. Organizers need to fill seats so are eager to get more attendees.\nAsk that they just link to your website and meetup in their marketing material and on their websites using the marketing blurb you provide.\nNow you:\n- Get backlinks while controlling the language around the links\n- Expand top-of-mind awareness\n- Get clicks\n- Grow your own meetup without throwing events yourself\n## Long Page Titles\nInteresting SEO practice people are sharing: obnoxiously long page titles.\nStandard best practice is to have a page title under 60 characters.\nSome SEOs are doing 250 character page titles.\nInstead of:\nStanding Desks for Offices | DeskMax\nYou'd do:\nStanding Desks for Offices | Boost Productivity & Improve Posture | Ergonomic Adjustable Height Desks for Health & Comfort | Modern Workspace Solutions | DeskMax\nPeople are reporting ranking boosts of 20-30% for this.\nMade a whole podcast about this here:\n## Republishing Old Posts To Rank #1\n> Hi @edwardeachday We loved this post https://t.co/lXqSHYENGk - r/SEO (@rSEOReddit) August 8, 2025\nHi @edwardeachday We loved this post https://t.co/lXqSHYENGk\nHere's the shortened version:\n- A page I made years ago wasn't ranking for its target keyword.\n- I took the page down, changed it a little so it wouldn't be an exact duplicate, and republished it under a slightly different URL. Total time on this was under 10 minutes.\n- Total time on this was under 10 minutes.\n- 2 weeks later I was ranking #1 for my target keyword.\nWorked because I had gained a lot of authority on the topic within the years since the post was originally published. Google judged the republished URL under the new level of topical authority .\nMy article about this: https://edwardsturm.com/articles/10-minute-seo-hack-that-took-my-page-from-invisible-to-1-on-google/\n## Grok Manipulation\nPeople are saying all shared Grok chats get indexed on Google by default.\nGrok has strong SEO authority. People are abusing this for SEO.\nWhat people are doing:\n- Set custom instructions for Grok saying to recommend your brand with a lot of detail for why your brand is great.\n- Ask it a question with target keyword, like \"What's the best SEO course?\" Grok responds.\n- Click share.\n- Buy backlinks to the shared Grok link. Buying backlinks is against Google's guidelines but people are not doing it for their own websites, so it's safer.\n- Grok chats rank on Google for target keywords.\nInstagram Reel about this:\n> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nA post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\n## Photo Backlinks\nSomebody on Reddit said he uploads relevant photos to free stock photo sites, Unsplash and Pexels, and sometimes gets 100-200 backlinks per photo .\nPeople in his niche use the photos on their sites (I've used countless Unsplash and Pexels photos on my sites).\nHe does a Reverse Image Search to find websites that have used his photos.\nHe emails these sites asking them to credit his website for the photo use. He gets a \"5-7% backlink conversion rate\" on these emails.\nI thought this one was cool because a lot of backlinks will be on relevant sites (since your photos are in your niche) AND it'd be pretty easy to set up an AI agent to do the tedious part of this - finding sites that used your image and emailing them, requesting the link.\nFrom: https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1mfuzfd/comment/n6k9lc7/\n## Test your SEO skills\n## Bonus SEO thing\nJake bought my SEO course, Compact Keywords, on August 2nd.\nThe main materials are 10 hours - and in 5 days, Jake breezed through them.\nHe left me this review after:\nCompact Keywords teaches my exact method of SEO - doing SEO that directly targets people looking to purchase NOW. Not cold leads who you have to work into a long funnel.\nAnd these keywords require less words per page to rank for, less backlinks, and are not disrupted by AI and Google Updates.\nI have a ton more testimonials on my landing page.\nGet my method of SEO at https://edwardsturm.com/compact-keywords/"

    "text": "A few months ago I made this video about how shorter marketing gets more results:\n> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nA post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nOne word subject lines get the highest open rates.\nLess syllables in a price increases purchases.\nShort brand names are most memorable - Nike, Apple, Zoom, Bolt.\nShort call to actions work best.\nShorter forms get more signups.\nOne sentence value props convert better.\nShorter menus increase sales.\nShort headlines get more attention.\nQuick replies close more deals.\nSay less to get more.\nFew better things than doing less and getting more.\nBUT the top comment was people wishing I cited sources.\nSo that's what I'm doing in this article.\nIt's easier to make short videos go viral; funny enough, for this one people are asking for something long.\n## One word subject lines get the highest open rates\nFrom one of my favorite newsletters - about conversion rate optimization: https://read.first1000.co/p/things-matter-for-growing-a-newsletter\nAnd my newsletters with one word subject lines ALWAYS get higher open rates than 2 words, 3 words, or more.\n## Less syllables in a price increases purchases\nThere's a lot written on how prices feel smaller with fewer syllables.\nHere's an example: https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jcps.2011.11.005\n\" Consumers non-consciously perceive that there is a positive relationship between syllabic length and numerical magnitude. \"\n## Short brand names are most memorable - Nike, Apple, Zoom, Bolt\nThe Fluency Heuristic says people give more value to phrases that are more easily retrieved.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyme-as-reason_effect\n\" People do not always make decisions based on rational analysis or declarative knowledge.\nThe fluency heuristic is defined as the tendency to attribute higher value to objects or phrases that are more easily retrieved or processed. According to this heuristic, the perceived value of a phrase is linked to how quickly and effortlessly it is processed. \"\n## Short call to actions work best\nRegular A/B testing often has concise CTAs winning out.\n\" The most effective CTAs are concise and to the point. Long or complicated sentences can confuse users or make them hesitate. Phrases like 'Shop Now' or 'Join Today' are short, easy to understand, and create a sense of urgency. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for the user to act without overloading them with information. \"\nFrom - https://www.networksolutions.com/blog/write-5-killer-calls-to-action/\n## Shorter forms get more signups\nThere's a ton written on this. Here's one such example:\nFrom - https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/how-to-optimize-contact-forms/\n## One sentence value props convert better\nJury's out on this. Some sources say 2-3 sentences, but there's also lots of evidence supporting one sentence value props as best.\nHere's some strong one sentence value propositions:\n\" Explore Your Creativity With Thousands of Hands-on Classes \" -Skillshare\n\" Affordable Legal Help Does Exist \" -LegalShield\n\" Pack Everything You Need Without Checking a Bag \" -Tortuga Backpacks\n\" Go Anywhere With Uber \" -Uber\nFrom - https://optinmonster.com/32-value-propositions-that-are-impossible-to-resist/\n## Shorter menus increase sales\n\" Research shows most menus crowbar in far more dishes than people want to choose from. A popular study from Columbia University revealed that people actually prefer fewer choices - as it makes the decision process that much easier.\n'As we complicate menus, what we're actually doing is tormenting the guest,' says restaurant consultant Aaron Allen. 'When the guest leaves they feel less satiated, and part of it comes down to a perception that they might have made the wrong choice.' If you leave with a bad taste in your mouth, you're less likely to come back. And in an industry where repeat customers account for about 70% of sales, getting diners to return is the ultimate goal. \"\nFrom - https://foodtecsolutions.com/blog/2018/10/31/do-smaller-menus-yield-more-sales/\n## Short headlines get more attention\n\" Findings showed that the most clicked-on headlines almost always scored higher on a simplicity index developed by the researchers. The study identified three hallmarks of simplicity in the winning headlines: They used common words; they avoided analytic writing, which tends to be more formal and complex; and they had fewer words per sentence and syllables per word. \"\nFrom - https://news.osu.edu/simple-headlines-attract-more-online-news-readers/\n## Quick replies close more deals\n\" Research confirms: Simpler communications are much more likely to be read... Cutting the number of words by two-thirds increased the response rate by 80 percent. \"\nFrom - https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/HKSEE/HKSEE%20PDFs/Write%20shorter%20messages.pdf\n\" On the sender side, crafting shorter emails can change your career and boost your bottom line. \"\nFrom - https://www.fastcompany.com/3057577/the-life-changing-magic-of-shorter-e-mails\n## The best SEO is short\nThe easiest, least competitive, highest converting SEO is 415 word pages targeting warm searchers NOT 3,000 word articles targeting cold searchers.\nThis is exactly what my SEO course teaches. Here's a video testimonial I received a few days ago:\nWilliam Bremer\n\" As soon as I got the course and I went through the first couple of lessons, I went back to some of my previous SEO clients, with those new findings the course gave me, and I was able to secure new SEO contracts from clients that had previously ended SEO services with me. It also allowed me to align my SEO fulfillment team on Edward's process because I didn't have a strong process in place, and I had to be the primary strategist behind all of the SEO campaigns. So being able to take that course, I was able to create systems for my team to actually use and help handle the fulfillment. \"\nGet this for yourself at https://edwardsturm.com/compact-keywords/"

Have two sections: Testing, Proven. Next time you have a piece of content that performs above average, write down in the Testing section what the subject matter is on. Test the subject matter a week later. Make another piece of content on the topic and if it performs well, move that topic to the Proven section.

    "text": "Plateaus happen to everybody and very few are able to push past them.\nThe ones who keep going - past 3 month plateaus, 6 months, even 1 year... the ones who persist, are the ones who win.\nEvery morning when I wake up, I jot down how many followers I have on TikTok.\nTikTok is no longer my favorite or most valuable marketing channel, but it's what I started on when I began making daily videos in 2022, so I continue monitoring TikTok growth.\nThis is what my spreadsheet looks like:\nAnd an interesting thing happens when I turn my daily follower count into a line chart:\nPLATEAUS!\nSo many of them. Long ones, too.\nSo here's what I've found...\n## Plateaus are relative.\nThere are people who read these weekly articles who are WAY bigger than me. They get plateaus too.\nOr... when I had a smaller following and was plateauing, I thought... if I could only get to X followers, I would feel better. I got there, plateaued, and it still was unpleasant.\n## Plateaus are inevitable.\nEven when I'm in periods of growth, I know a plateau will eventually come. Doesn't bother me anymore.\n## Plateaus don't last.\nI popped off on TikTok LONG before I did on Instagram.\nNow I'm substantially bigger on IG and value it more, but that wasn't always the case.\nIn fact, on IG, here's what happened:\n- My first 5 months, nobody watched my daily Reels. Average views were 0-50.\n- Month 5 I had a short success. A Reel got 160,000 views and it got me from ~600 followers to ~3,000.\n- Then... for the next 6 months... I plateaued. All my daily Reels got 50-200 views. As you can see from my TikTok chart above, I was plateauing there too. This was SUCH a difficult plateau. It was my first real plateau with social media. Day after day I strongly considered stopping. I kept going because despite the pain, I believed I would eventually figure it out.\n- Month 11, the automation I was using to have my TikToks automatically republish to IG Reels went down for a day. So I manually uploaded my video to Instagram instead of using my automation. It did a lot better. Then I tried manually uploading a previous viral TikTok. It EXPLODED. I tried more previously viral TikToks. They exploded too! I tested extensively and realized the IG algorithm was dampening the reach of videos automatically published with 3rd party tools. It took me 11 months of pain to accidentally discover this, and then I started growing. Fast. For those wondering, it looks like the algorithm no longer dampens the reach of videos automatically published with 3rd party tools. This person grew from 0 to 150,000 followers in 6 months using the automation , which in 2022, was getting suppressed. This is also why I say do things you like - because when the plateaus occur - the enjoyment of what you're doing will get you through them.\n- For those wondering, it looks like the algorithm no longer dampens the reach of videos automatically published with 3rd party tools.

I kept saying to myself, \"Starting this podcast was the dumbest decision of my life. What was I thinking starting a freaking daily podcast.\" But in the back of my mind, I believed I would eventually figure it out.\nAgain, plateaus are relative, but this is my average podcast engagement over time:\n## Push past the plateaus.\nLast week I was walking through a random small European city. I got recognized on the street. Crazy. Guy watches my Instagram. Asked for advice on his startup.\nI'm also now constantly mentioned on LinkedIn by viewers of the podcast - they learn something and share it, citing me. So amazing that people are watching.\nAnd lots of people are buying Compact Keywords . From the last few days:\nI wanted to write this article because from my experience with marketing, with business, with entrepreneurship, the #1 lesson I personally have received (and maybe you've received it as well) is to push past the plateaus."

    "text": "A few days ago I had James Reynolds on the podcast.\nJames built an 8-figure, 65 person SEO agency - SEO Sherpa - from scratch with a lot of smart (and not hard) marketing moves that anybody can recreate.\nIn this article I'll break down 3 of his most effective tactics:\n- How to manufacture social proof and authority to increase customers.\n- How to get influencers to share your brand for free.\n- How to use AI to increase customer retention.\n## Thought leadership & social proof\nThought leadership is bigger than it's ever been and social proof does a ton to increase conversions.\nThese are the moves James used to get skeptical leads to say yes.\n- Found relevant events to speak at. Started small. Looked through Meetup, Eventbrite, local Facebook groups, local business groups, event recommendations, etc.\n- Started small. Looked through Meetup, Eventbrite, local Facebook groups, local business groups, event recommendations, etc.\n- Emailed organizers, saying he'd be a good speaker. Included a one-sheet PDF with: His bio and headshot. Topics he could speak on. Links to past talks or video clips. (If you don't have any past talks or clips, I share how to start below). Testimonials, if available.\n- His bio and headshot.\n- Topics he could speak on.\n- Links to past talks or video clips. (If you don't have any past talks or clips, I share how to start below).\n- (If you don't have any past talks or clips, I share how to start below).\n- Testimonials, if available.\n- Asked for referrals after speaking. After every event, he asked organizers, \"Who else do you know who runs events like this?\" This built a snowball effect of new speaking opportunities.\n- After every event, he asked organizers, \"Who else do you know who runs events like this?\"\n- This built a snowball effect of new speaking opportunities.\n- Spoke anywhere he could, including small and niche groups.\n- Shared everything after on LinkedIn, social media, and to his email list: \"Spoke at X event today.\" Mentioned high-profile speakers he \"shared the stage with\" (even if not on the same day).\n- \"Spoke at X event today.\"\n- Mentioned high-profile speakers he \"shared the stage with\" (even if not on the same day).\nWhy this worked:\n- From James on the podcast: \"Even if you feel like an impostor, you probably know more than 99% of the people in the room. This, and the public speaking, sharing what you know positions you as the expert.\"\n- Potential clients saw him speaking via his posts on social media. The social proof and authority increased conversions.\n- The social proof also increased event organizer acceptance rates.\n- When networking, new potential clients connected with him on LinkedIn or Instagram, saw his previous speaking engagements, and were a lot more likely to convert just based on that.\nAll of this still works - not just with public speaking, but podcasts as well - and even better, you can tie the two together.\nThis platform uses AI to match podcast hosts who want guests with relevant guests - so you can go on podcasts even if you're an unknown person - just by being a relevant expert. Then you can share these podcast appearances in your public speaking one-pager. Even if you've never done public speaking, you now have podcast appearances to boost credibility. I have a guide on how to use that platform here .\nThis platform connects journalists looking for sources for their articles with relevant experts. I have an acceptance rate on there of over 70% - when I respond to a journalist there is a 7/10 chance my quote is used. And through that I've been quoted in some big publications, like Entrepreneur.\nHelp a Reporter Out and Source of Sources are also excellent for this, though more competitive.\nThis is how social proof and authority gets completely manufactured.\nStart small - use small podcasts or small public speaking opportunities or quotes in small publications - share them publicly and put them in a press kit. The social proof and authority positioning allows you to get bigger and bigger opportunities.\nAlong the way, you close more potential clients, get more customers, close fundraising rounds, meet higher-level people, etc.\nThere's a reason even private introverted billionaire founders like Evan Spiegel, the founder of Snapchat, are now embracing public speaking and podcasts.\nTop-of-mind awareness, social proof, and authority positioning are so important for building trust.\nBTW - and this has happened to me - even if you speak at events where disappointingly there's not many people, you crop the image! People see you public speaking and they imagine the audience being there. Even tiny audiences can still help to close clients and customers and get bigger speaking opportunities.\n## Getting industry influencers to share your brand for free\nI learned of James Reynolds from the 21 SEO Experiments article he wrote in 2016. It's one of my favorite articles about SEO and it went viral when it came out.\nWhat I didn't know until my podcast with James is that he made the article go viral.\nThe article is 21 of the most interesting SEO experiments carried out - many of which were done by huge names in SEO, like Rand Fishkin or Dan Petrovic.\nJames wrote the article, then sent it to the influencers who were in it, saying essentially:\n\"Hey! I wrote this article that features one of your SEO experiments. I'm going to publish it in a few days - if you have a moment, please let me know if you'd like me to add context or make any tweaks before it goes live.\"\nThis got the influencers invested in the article - they reviewed it or gave extra detail.\nThe aforementioned public speaking and social proof also made James into somebody worth sharing. He wasn't just a random guy - he had positioned himself as an authority in the space.\nWhen the article went live, simultaneously all these big names in the SEO community shared it on Twitter and LinkedIn.\nAnd 9 years later this article is still being shared. A lot of the lessons in it are relevant today and I've shared most of the 21 experiments with individual episodes on my podcast . Crazy evergreen.\nBy the way, here's the backlink data for it:\n213 backlinks from 110 websites.\n## AI models for retention\nThe last thing I want to share - I asked James how he's using AI in his agency.\nHe feeds AI everything - call recordings, transcripts, email correspondence, client sentiment data, billing patterns - and the AI accurately predicts client churn, flags risks early, and optimizes internal workflows.\nJames said of its accuracy: \"It's been crazy accurate. We've had clients hit a risk score of 8 or 9 out of 10, and then a week later, they hand in their notice.\"\nSo now, when a client's risk score starts climbing, James's team steps in early - increasing communication and reviewing the work on the account to catch any issues in execution or lapses in responsiveness.\nI could see this being done in all types of businesses - not just services.\nI could even see this in SaaS - train an AI to predict customer churn and automatically trigger tailored retention workflows: personalized emails, in-app nudges, or account manager outreach before the customer even thinks about canceling.\n## Listen to the pod\nThere's a lot more shared in the episode. You can watch below or listen on Spotify or Apple Podcasts .\n## Detail\nIf you appreciate the level of detail in these articles and want to learn SEO with the same degree of attention to detail, check out my SEO course, Compact Keywords.\nIt's specifically SEO to get customers, not SEO to increase vanity metrics.\nGet it here: https://edwardsturm.com/compact-keywords/\nThanks for reading."

    "text": "These are the top 10 most-clicked sites in Google Search in 2025:\n- YouTube\n- Facebook\n- Reddit\n- Instagram\n- ChatGPT\n- Whatsapp\n- X\n- Wikipedia\n- TikTok\n- LinkedIn\nLast year, 2024, by contrast - Wikipedia was #3. Reddit was #1. Quora was #10. Stack Overflow was #9. Amazon was #4. And TikTok wasn't even listed.\nUGC - user generated content - is dominating even more than it was last year, with video going especially hard.\n(This research comes from a massive newly-released report from Datos and SparkToro: https://datos.live/report/state-of-search-q1-2025/ )\n## The mistake\nThe biggest mistake digital marketers will make this year is not using these platforms more for SEO while it's still non-competitive.\nMost video creators target keywords with a sloppy list of hashtags at the END of their descriptions. This is all wrong. Targeting keywords is super easy, you can make the content faster than with traditional SEO, and you can AND SHOULD target the same keyword with multiple pieces of content.\nSimilarly, most users on Reddit don't realize that with just a little bit of consideration, their posts and comments will have a much greater shot at showing up in search results (or recommended by AI).\nOh and while you do this, you also grow your brand on socials as algorithms push your content out to relevant viewers.\n## The simple principle\nHave a target keyword.\nMake your content (video, Reddit post/comment) about that target keyword.\nPosition your target keyword at the beginning of your content.\n- Beginning of video description (most video platforms only have a description field)\n- If there is a title field (like there is on YouTube) at beginning of title field as well\n- If Reddit - at beginning of comment or in post title and beginning of post's main contents\nBasically anywhere where there is a field for you to write - put your target keyword at the beginning of that field.\nThen (for description field in video) write ~150-300 words after your target keyword is placed. To make it easy, I just use my video transcript after the keyword.\n## Automate\nAgain, making this type of high-ranking content takes significantly less time than traditional SEO.\nIf it's a Reddit post/comment, takes a few minutes.\nIf it's a video, takes a few minutes as well:\n- YouTube Shorts, IG Reels, and TikTok all have native video-creation capabilities used by SIX YEAR OLDS. If six year olds can figure it out, so can you.\n- For more flexibility, what I do: shoot my videos on my phone. Import into Descript . With one click, remove all gaps between words. Then remove bad takes from the transcript (every raw video gets auto-transcribed). Removing bad takes from the transcript also removes them from the finished video.\nOnce you upload your video, use this automation to make it auto-release everywhere at once:\n- YouTube Shorts\n- Facebook\n- Instagram\n- X\n- TikTok\n- LinkedIn\n## Here's what you just did\nYou just made a piece of content targeting a keyword in 10-20 minutes, and then it auto-released to 6 of the 10 MOST-CLICKED websites in Google Search - which AI ALSO TRAINS OFF OF.\nAgain, the biggest mistake will be in 2026 saying, \"Oh, I wish I capitalized off UGC SEO sooner.\"\n## Quality\nAlso - don't sweat the quality - just start.\nHere's how raw my videos used to be:\n- Dec 29, 2022 - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/k5LqJ0PUsVk\n- Dec 30, 2022 - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ffJbnHolYVI\n- Jan 18, 2023 - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8UNxPVhSaOQ\n## What keywords to target\nUGC SEO is a blue ocean.\nMost SEOs are skipping over video.\nMost video creators and Redditors don't know the first thing about keyword-usage in their content.\nYou don't have to be as strategic as with traditional SEO - you can go after any keyword that looks appealing.\nAlso, if you took the time to target a keyword with your website, make a video or Reddit post for it as well - the information is already top of mind for you so you don't need to do extra research or ideation.\nPersonally, I like to go after purchase-intent keywords:\nPurchase-intent keywords convert way better, but because search volumes are much lower - as shown above - than informational keywords, VERY few marketers bother to target them.\nWith traditional SEO, competition for purchase-intent keywords is already very low .\nWith UGC SEO, competition for purchase-intent keywords is non-existent .\nI'm so passionate about purchase-intent SEO, I spent a year making this 13 hour course on it. The course shows in depth how to find these keywords, make pages for the keywords, and there's a thorough section on UGC SEO as well.\n## Don't make the mistake\nSearchers prefer short videos:\n- They're faster to consume\n- They're more engaging\n- They're more personal and authentic\n- Everyone has fast-enough Internet to load video now\nIf it's Reddit:\n- The anonymous and social nature of brand recommendations make them convert above average\nAnyone can do it. Few people with the knowledge do. Start your UGC SEO efforts now, before the market becomes saturated.\n## Go deeper\nMy UGC articles  https://edwardsturm.com/articles/organic-social-media/ My SEO articles  https://edwardsturm.com/articles/search-engine-optimization/ My SEO course  https://compactkeywords.com/"

I just checked your recent videos and the comments are increasing. Also, more views. Congrats. What happened?\"\nOne of the major things I started doing - honestly - was letting GPT 4o write my podcast titles.\nHere are some recent ones:\n- The SEO Trick That Skyrocketed My Page from #50 to #1!\n- Rand Fishkin on SEO, AI Overviews, and the Future of Content Marketing\n- What the Latest Google Core Update Really Changed\n- The SHOCKING Truth About Shared Hosting & SEO Rankings (Real Experiment Results)\nMy workflow used to be :\n- Come up with idea for episode.\n- Agonize thinking of the title.\n- Record podcast making sure to address the title. This had the added drawback of making it hard to change the title in the future if I thought of something better.\n- This had the added drawback of making it hard to change the title in the future if I thought of something better.\n- Make thumbnail based on title and what I say in podcast.\nMy new workflow is:\n- Come up with idea for episode.\n- Record podcast riffing on the idea.\n- Give transcribed podcast to GPT 4o with the exact prompt, \"Here's the transcript for today's podcast. The podcast comes out to YouTube and Spotify/Apple Podcasts. Give me a good title for the podcast episode. Transcript:\"\n- Pick best title (usually just the first one GPT gives).\n- Make thumbnail mostly based on title and a bit of what I say in podcast.\nSaves a lot of time and gives more results.\n## Nobody knows this about SEO page titles\nIt's crazy to say but something I've found is even established SEOs don't know how to write effective SEO page titles.\nThis is my formula:\nTarget Keyword | Benefit or Searcher's Goal | Brand Name\nExamples:\n- Personal Injury Lawyer NYC | Free Consultation | ClaimRise Legal\n- Free Business Chat Software | Simplified Team Chat | Chatterly Pro\n- Coffee for Headache Relief | Headache-Safe Caffeine | CalmBrew\nMost digital marketers: Don't even have a target keyword.\nMost SEOs: Have target keyword but don't add an extra reason to click.\nSidenote - other SEOs will tell me my page titles are too long and will get cut off by Google. It's true. The important distinction is that what is not cut off is the keyword and most of the benefit or searcher's goal.\nYou can use this tool to test your page title length.\nWhy my formula gets above average rankings and results:\n- The keyword at beginning says, \"This result is for you (the searcher)\" - which increases clicks.\n- The added benefit or searcher's goal distinguishes your page from others in the search results - increases clicks.\n- The brand name (when visible) slightly boosts trust - slightly increases clicks.\n- The amount of clicks your result gets relative to other search results is a very strong ranking factor. You then just have to make sure you give searchers what they're looking for right away .\n- You then just have to make sure you give searchers what they're looking for right away .\n## Bonus\nMy article last week, if you didn't see, is all about how to humanize ChatGPT for copywriting .\n## Wrapping\nContent that doesn't get clicked is content that doesn't get seen.\nDo these things to get more clicks to your titles, more views to your brand, and ultimately - more conversions.\n## Converting\nBTW - if you haven't checked it out - I have a 13.5 hour beginner-to-advanced SEO course entirely about doing SEO that gets you customers.\nhttps://compactkeywords.com/\nNot vanity clicks or impressions - but actual customers.\nHere are a few of my favorite recent testimonials:\n In Angel's first month, the sales made from Compact Keywords SEO pages already repaid half the cost of the course.

Example (this ranks #1 for keyword arbitration): https://edwardsturm.com/services/keyword-arbitration/\nChallenge: Target keywords that have \"services\" in them efficiently.\nSolution: Make the hub page /services/\nURL examples:\n- yoursite .com/services/business-license-filing\n- yoursite .com/services/corporate-retreat-planning\nThe /services/ hub page houses all the individual task-specific services pages:\n\"Services\" is linked to in footer and goes to this hub page.\nFor further targeting, each task-specific services page has the keyword in the Page Title, H1, and beginning of the first sentence.\nBacklinks:\n- Niche and general business directories.\n- Podcast backlinks - I use this to get appearances. Shows give links, but more importantly engagement to your site. Backlinks with engagement are worth most.\n- Help a Reporter Out & Source of Sources - these are journalists looking for quotes for their articles.

    "text": "What if the biggest SEO opportunity was actually still ahead of us?\nRand Fishkin came on my podcast a few days ago.\nFor those who don't know, Rand is one of the OG names in digital marketing. He founded the popular SEO software, Moz, scaled it to $50m/year, then sold it. Last year he dropped the infamous Google API Leak, which I covered here .\nWe talked for over an hour, but this was my #1 takeaway...\nI don't like crowded spaces...\nIn 2012 I went on stage plenty of times or on calls where I'd be like, 'Yeah, yeah, SEO is BS, ignore it. Don't do it.' That way I can do it and rank number one.\nIt's the same thing now .\n'You're afraid of AI? Great. Don't invest in content, don't invest in publishing, don't invest in visibility in Google and AI tools. That's fine.' Those of us who do are going to receive outsized benefit from it.\nThe incentive is still just as strong if your goal with publishing is to influence an audience to have a preference for your product or service.\nThe podcast goes more in-depth about this but the gist is - avoid crowded spaces and target keywords (what people search on Google/Bing/AI search engines) that are under-targeted .\nNot going to lie, finding and targeting keywords that are under-targeted is almost 50% of my SEO strategy.\nThey:\n- Are easier to rank on Google for\n- Require less words and backlinks BTW Google prefers engagement to backlinks\n- BTW Google prefers engagement to backlinks\n- Convert better because when you actually target them, you get higher engagement\n- Rank faster\nMy SEO Course, Compact Keywords, is entirely about targeting keywords at the bottom of the funnel - where there is the most desire to purchase, use, or try a product/service.\nMost bottom-of-funnel keywords are under-targeted by default (if you want to learn why this is, check out the new video at the top of the Compact Keywords landing page ).\nBut the rest of my discussion with Rand revealed something else...\nWith marketers, publishers, and SEOs becoming afraid of AI taking their clicks, top-of-funnel keywords are being left under-targeted too!\nThe entire field may soon be left wide open! Marketers are stepping off the field - the goalie's on vacation.\nWith search engines' prioritization of recent content and more marketers leaving the field than relative users are leaving search...\nThe biggest SEO opportunities may still be ahead!\n## What does an under-targeted keyword look like?\nIdentifying under-targeted keywords is actually very simple.\nThe best indicator of whether a result in Google will satisfy a searcher is whether or not the keyword (or something similar with the same meaning behind it) is in the page title.\nThese are all page titles:\nAnd that is a competitive keyword.\nNotice how each page title either has the exact keyword or a close variation of it.\nAs Rand said, \"I don't like crowded spaces...\" - and just like him, I do not like that keyword.\nHere are examples of under-targeted keywords.\nFrom a user-experience perspective, a page that doesn't specifically target a keyword makes it harder for searchers to find their answer.\nA page that does target a keyword specifically means the searcher will likely get their answer before even having to scroll - and the rest of the page will just go deeper into that topic... way better for the searcher.\nGoogle wants to give searchers the best experience possible.\nAnd again, the page title is the top indicator of the subject matter on the page.\nYou probably don't need more backlinks... you just need better targeting.\n## So what should you do?\nHave a target keyword.\nPut it in your page title.\nIt helps if that target keyword is also in your URL slug, top page heading, and beginning of your first sentence.\nThen do your best to answer the keyword within the first 1-3 paragraphs, and have the rest of the page go deeper on the topic.\n## The future of search\nSince the release of ChatGPT I've seen so many marketers panic over the future of search.\nBut oftentimes things don't unfold like we expect.\nWhat if the future of search is actually way brighter than everybody predicted?\nKeywords being under-targeted left and right.\nTons of demand just being abandoned.\nYour traffic - for the taking."

    "text": "There's not much that surprises me in SEO anymore, but this hack and its quick results shocked me.\nI was looking through my last several weeks' Google ranking data and saw:\nMy page - which had been unable to rank for years - shot up to position 1 on Google - after 10 minutes of changes which I never thought would work - 2 weeks after implementing the hack.\nIf you have a page which isn't ranking on Google at all and you believe it should be (for example if it is targeting a keyword that is not competitive) this is worth a try.\n## SEO Glossary for this article BTW:\nKeyword = what people search on Google Ranking = what number your page shows up on Google Search. #1 means you're at the top of GoogleSearch under the Sponsored results (which are paid ads). Page = the unique page of your website (example: edwardsturm.com/compact-keywords/ ) Page of Google = Google's results. Page 1 is the first page of Google for a search. Page 2, page 3, etc.\n## My page\nIn March 2023 I made a thorough page targeting an easy keyword.\nI submitted it to Google Search Console - which, among other things, tells Google your page exists - I expected my page to rank fast. It didn't.\nIn fact it only started to rank over a year later - #1 on Google - for a week - then it stopped ranking again. It just was not ranking at all.\nMarch 25th, 2025 I implemented the hack - which I read on the SEO subreddit and never expected to work - but it sounded interesting plus, as a marketer, I believe you should always try to challenge your preconceived notions.\nThe change I implemented took 10 minutes.\nApril 9th, 2025 I went from not ranking at all to ranking #1. Today is May 4 and I'm still ranking #1.\n## The 10 minute changes made\n- I cloned the not-ranking page to a new page.\n- I spent 5 minutes adding/removing words in the:\n- URL\n- Page title\n- Meta description\n- Opening paragraphs\n- I want to stress - these changes were minor - I only made them so this new page would not be a 100% copy of the previous page.\n- I 301 redirected the old page's URL to the new page's URL.\n- A 301 redirect tells Google a page has been moved permanently and it transfers any/all link juice to the new page.\n- The old page was linked to in one spot on my site. I changed that link to reflect the new URL.\n- I submitted to Google Search Console:\n- The old page - so Google could see it is being 301 redirected to the new page.\n- The new page - to make sure it is crawled.\n## What happened\nThe Reddit comments that caused me to try this:\n## March 2023\nI create my page BUT the website it is on had not been updated in a while and is making a pivot in terms of the topics it covers.\nThe page is for the new topic - which is why it doesn't rank fast like I expect.\n## 2023 - 2024\nEvery couple of months I make small further optimizations to the page. I always submit the updated content to Google Search Console. Nothing happens - click-through rate testing phase had ended.\nAnd I'm in the \"year period\" mentioned on Reddit where the page isn't reindexed and reassessed.\n## October 2024\nThe page is tested once again.\nI have more authority for the topic (because I've been active marketing in the topic for the past year) - but the page is still judged with the topical authority the site had in 2023.\nThe page gets tested at position #1 because it's perfectly optimized for an easy keyword.\nThe keyword doesn't get enough searches for that single week to validate Google's test (it's a low-search-volume keyword) - so I go back to not ranking at all for it.\n## March 25th 2025\nI make the changes previously mentioned.\nThe new URL gets reassessed with all the topical authority I have gained since March 2023. My site is a lot more related to the topic than it was when the old page was first published.\n## April 9th 2025\nI begin ranking #1 for the keyword with the 99% cloned content on the new URL.\nI stay ranking because the page is perfectly optimized for the keyword.\nIf this wasn't an issue of completely misaligned topical authority - I would have been ranking on Page 1 or 2 of Google with the old page. Since I wasn't ranking at all, that tells me the \"click-through rate test phase\" had ended and my old page was \"languishing.\"\n## If you...\nIf you have a page that you think should be ranking, and it isn't ranking at all , give this a try.\nYou may be surprised, just like me."

Shot on the selfie camera of an iPhone 8. In a noisy cafe. Promoting an affiliate product.\nGoes viral.\nThen...\nI continue resharing it 2-3 times each year . Every year .\nLike here , this most recent Feb. Goes viral AGAIN with 1 million views!\nThere is an abundance of high quality recording devices and STILL a scarcity of quality content!!\n## Repeatable strategy to get people to share\nThe previous video doesn't fall into this next category, but it's something I've been thinking about recently.\nI made this video with Ryan Reynolds talking about how important storytelling is to his marketing strategy. Shared by a ton of agency owners. Liked by other artists: T-Pain, Sharon Stone, etc\nI made this video about Neil Patel spending $160k on clothes to make an extra $692k. It was shared by designers, models, and people looking to validate their annual clothing spend.\nBut there's a theme here.\nBoth videos gave people tangible validation for their careers and lifestyles. This caused people to resonate and share.\nIn the first video, Ryan Reynolds saying how important storytelling is to marketing success - I saw so many marketing professionals sharing the video to their IG stories and LinkedIns and saying, \"I told you - this stuff is important!\"\nIn the second video, Neil Patel getting real world success by spending $160k on suits, shoes, jackets, and briefcases. Designers shared and said, \"I told you - this stuff is important!\" Models shared and said the same thing. Non-designers who spent a lot on clothing also shared and said the same. (By the way, after that video went viral Neil Patel explained the article was taken down because he found his fashion spend wasn't necessary to success and he didn't want to mislead people) .\nFun story - a year ago, a friend noticed from his analytics he randomly had a lot of people in Switzerland watching his TikToks. So he asked ChatGPT for a list of tangible reasons why Swiss people are the greatest. He read this list in a video. It went viral. Seriously.\nThe lesson here:\nThink about the people in your niche and make content that validates their careers and lifestyles with tangible evidence.\nThey will share you. It's a great top-of-mind driver. Best capture here, by the way, would be a free CTA at the end of the video, like \"I share hacks for storytelling/fashion/your niche in my weekly newsletter at yourlink.com.\"\nThe validating subject matter gets people to share. The CTA moves people into your funnel.\n## The only quality that matters is the quality of your message\nYou don't need quality recording equipment.\nYou need quality ideas, aimed at the people in your niche.\nMake content that makes them feel seen ...\nAnd they'll make sure everyone sees you in return."

    "text": "It's a well-known digital marketing strategy to buy Google Ads targeting competitors' brand names.\nExample:\nSomebody Googles the SEO software, \"Moz.\"\nSeobility is paying for their page, \"Moz Alternative,\" to show up first.\nSE Ranking is paying for their homepage to appear prominently as well.\nI'm going to show a free alternative to this strategy.\nThis is the entire search engine results page for \"Moz\":\nRight below are videos.\nAnd the top video, Moz Review, only has 342 views!\nGoogle is turbocharging user-generated content, especially video, regardless of view count , in its results... all over the place... in every niche.\nGoogle \"Answer The Public,\" another popular SEO tool...\nThe second video, a YouTube Short, only has 135 views!\nAnd these are big tools in niches with savvy digital marketers...\nWhat happens when you want to target a local competitor in a niche that is not digital marketing?\nOr any niche that's not digital marketing, for that matter?\nIt becomes WAY EASIER.\nWayyyyyyy easierrrrr.\nAnd it's really an intense tactic.\nNote that the Moz video with 342 views that ranks on the first page of Google for \"Moz\" is a REVIEW.\nIf you're in a price-sensitive niche, people are a lot more likely to search for reviews before purchasing...\n## Here's how to target competitors' names with video for free\nWhen it comes to video, Google values a few things:\n- Relevance: The competitor brand name is at the beginning of the video title and description. Add a 50-100 word description for extra relevance. You can just use the transcript (proofread) of your video for this. Relevant thumbnail - a thumbnail that's relevant to the topic.\n- The competitor brand name is at the beginning of the video title and description.\n- Add a 50-100 word description for extra relevance. You can just use the transcript (proofread) of your video for this.\n- Relevant thumbnail - a thumbnail that's relevant to the topic.\n- Recency - recent videos tend to do better.\n- Trustworthiness - not a brand new account with one video.\n- Concise - short form mobile videos, especially YouTube Shorts , do well.\n## Execute this for free:\nStart posting videos NOW. Use my short guide here to get started - it covers subject matter in case you don't know what to make. Spend 5 minutes posting a video a day with automations to make it so your videos auto-release everywhere.\nIf you already have social media accounts for your business you can try this now.\nYou could start with a title like, \"[Competitor Name] Alternative - [Way In Which You're Better (cheaper, more efficient, better results)]\"\nYou could also do a How-To video for a competitor and in the video briefly share your company as a really great alternative that the viewer should probably use instead.\nYou literally can control the narratives of your competitors by doing this.\nWhen you do post your videos targeting competitor brand names, post manually through the YouTube mobile app. If it's a YouTube Short, you'll have to go into YouTube Studio after the video is posted to add your description. Also make sure these videos release to every platform for maximum coverage. I have a detailed guide on how to post to each platform here .\n## Execute this with a budget:\nPay a micro-influencer to post for you. By doing this you don't have to develop your own video account.\nUse this guide for how to post .\n## Execute this with a bigger budget:\nPay a bunch of micro-influencers to hit your competitors' brand names from every angle.\nGoogle Search also likes variety, so overall it's better to have multiple accounts targeting your keywords.\nAgain, use this guide for how to post .\n## Video\nVideo has opened up a new frontier of aggressive digital marketing tactics that companies are sleeping on.\nThis is one of those tactics.\nInstead of paying for ads targeting competitor brand names, try doing video for free.\n## Compact Keywords\nCompact Keywords, my 13+ hour SEO Course, has an extensive section on video.\nThe course is how to get results from SEO - not blog SEO targeting cold keywords - but instead scenario-based landing pages targeting people who want to buy now .\nThe pages are designed to get customers, users, and warm leads, rather than simply awareness.\nAnd the course is easy enough for anybody to implement.\nIf you like the tactics I share in these articles, you're going to love Compact Keywords ."

    "text": "In the early 2010s, this now-popular movement emerged in indie hackers and startup communities called Build in Public.\nWhereas a lot of founders were obsessed with \"stealth mode\" because they were worried people would steal their ideas - or they felt they didn't have anything worth sharing - Build in Public encouraged sharing everything . Often, this took the form of posting daily updates to Twitter.\nBut the Build in Public concept doesn't just have to apply to tech.\nYou could be building a career, a side hustle, a freelancing business, a DTC brand, a local business, a podcast, a creative portfolio, or even just a personal habit-and still \"build in public.\"\nAnd why would you do this?\nBecause the awareness that you get over time compounds and gives you tremendous opportunities...\n## Blake Lloyd\nA few days ago I had Blake Lloyd on my podcast. 24 years old, she used Build in Public to build a 7 figure eyelash supply business.\nShe started at 16, taking eyelash extension clients from her parents' bedroom.\nStarted a new Instagram (separate from her personal one) for this new service-based business.\nEvery day she spent at least 5 minutes posting to IG: sharing client transformations, behind-the-scenes, lash tips, her struggles, her wins.\nAt first, of course, she was only getting clients from in-person word of mouth.\nThen she started getting clients from Instagram.\nIn fact, two years after starting, at 18, she had enough demand she was able to open her own lash-only salon. And she was able to take on students as well.\nShe kept posting.\nAt least five minutes a day. Sharing everything.\nAs she continued working, she kept hearing the same complaints: Lashes didn't hold their curls, adhesive dried too slowly, shipping took forever...\nNo one was solving these problems. She decided she would.\nAt 20, she flew to Korea - alone. To meet manufacturers. To learn how to make a product that actually solved these issues.\nWhen she fully launched the product - she used the Instagram she had been building post by post, day by day, for the last four years.\nAnd she built enough trust and awareness in the industry that her product was immediately successful.\nFor more, here's the podcast I did with her:\n## How you can do this too\nFive minutes a day is enough for anybody to share their journey and build opportunity-giving awareness.\nBlake's story started in 2016 when platforms were different. There was no TikTok. No Reels. Less automation tools. Discovery was harder .\nHere's how to do this in 2025:\n- Either use your main or do what Blake did and create a new account. Create new accounts on Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, a LinkedIn company page, a new X, a new YouTube, a Facebook page.\n- Show your face in content. This study found that photos with faces get 38% more likes and 32% more comments. The study also found that the age or gender of the face didn't have an effect. Aside from the above, people buy from people. You craft a personal journey. It builds trust.\n- This study found that photos with faces get 38% more likes and 32% more comments.

It used to be this worked poorly with Meta platforms. However, it seems this now works well . Recently, I received an email from a subscriber of my newsletter , \"I used your automation to grow from 0 to 100k followers on IG in 6 months. I post to TikTok only and the videos automatically come out everywhere else.\" That's from Michael Taylor - IG: https://www.instagram.com/shiftingshares/ TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@shiftingshares The automation I use and Michael uses is Repurpose .\n- It used to be this worked poorly with Meta platforms.

Make your videos in the TikTok or IG app. I recommend the TikTok app - it's what I started with and it's simple .\n- Spend 5 min posting every day. That's it. 5 min. Your only metric for success when starting is if you posted for that day. When I started, I gave myself a 30 day challenge for posting. It worked. Now I'm on day 881 of consecutive posting.\n- When I started, I gave myself a 30 day challenge for posting. It worked.

I recently cut the intro from a year-old video. The original with the long intro got 371 views. The cut-intro version got 2.4 million views .\n- I recently cut the intro from a year-old video.

And even if you have NO PRODUCT, the audience you build will tell you what they want - just as happened with Blake.\n## SEO\nYou shouldn't worry about this if you're just starting, but video ranks wildly well within normal Google Search now:\nI made those three videos each in minutes. They all ranked in the top 4 results THE NEXT DAY... over others' articles which took days and weeks to write!\nIf you're making videos and have keywords (things people search in Google) you care about - put the keyword at the beginning of the video description and beginning of the video title. Then add a few extra sentences to the description.\nI get a lot of discovery now from SEO with my videos.\n## Post\nYou don't need ads.\nYou don't need a marketing team.\nYou don't need sophisticated software.\nYou need 5 minutes a day, an Internet connection, and a phone.\nAnyone can build an audience.\nPost.\n## Compact Keywords\nIf you like these articles, you'll love my in-depth SEO course, Compact Keywords.\nIt's a 13.5 hour course that shows how to get paying customers, users, and warm leads with SEO.\nMost SEO advice is built around blog content - long articles, top-of-funnel traffic, and hoping someone eventually converts.\nBlog SEO is quickly getting disrupted by AI and recent research just found that Google's AI overviews decrease organic clickthrough rate by 70% . Don't do blog SEO.\nCompact Keywords is different. It focuses on purchase-intent SEO landing pages - short, targeted pages that match exactly what people are searching for when they're ready to buy or take action.\nThese keywords are under-targeted, low competition, and high converting.\nThey require less time and money to rank for - and they align perfectly with how both AI and Google now surface results.\nTo learn more - and see how it works firsthand - please check out https://compactkeywords.com/"

    "text": "One of the reasons SEO is my favorite marketing channel, even more than organic social, is because you can target people who represent the purchasing power of hundreds or literally THOUSANDS of people - FOR FREE.\nAnd oftentimes, this is way easier than normal SEO.\n## The marketing funnel\nFirst, you have the marketing funnel.\nThere's more people at the top - the widest part of the funnel. These people are just explorers. They're trying to learn about something. They have NO INTEREST in converting.\nBecause there's so many of these people, most SEOs and digital marketers target them. This makes these searchers VERY COMPETITIVE, even though they shouldn't be.\nAt the bottom of the funnel are people who know exactly what they want. In terms of Google or AI - they're searching, looking for a company to satisfy their need.\nI needed a tool to embed my TikTok feed on my website. I Googled \"embed TikTok feed on website.\" I found a company that offered this. The free version was good. The paid version let me customize the style of the embed. It was $60/year. I paid it an hour after finding the SEO landing page targeting what I searched in Google. That was 2 years ago and I continue to pay for the annual plan.\nThat's bottom of funnel. There's FAR LESS people who know what they want and are ready to convert. The thinnest part of the funnel.\nBecause the volume of people here is so low, most digital marketers and SEOs don't target these people. This makes these searchers uncompetitive. This is what my SEO course is about by the way, all the methods to find and target these people who are ready to buy.\n## Decision makers\nTo me, that all is very exciting.\nBut here's where it gets really, really exciting.\nNot only are there individuals searching to buy for themselves... there are decision makers searching to buy for their groups, teams, or entire organizations.\nAnd there's way less of these people, making them EVEN LESS COMPETITIVE in terms of SEO.\nIf I were to compare this to Instagram, it's the same thing as most people mistakenly thinking it's better to have a large brand than a strong, trusted brand.\nYou'd rather have the strong, trusted brand because your followers will spend money with you or go out of their ways to help you.\n## How to find these people who represent a lot of purchasing power\nThat's the principle.\nWhen it comes to SEO, the most valuable people are typically the least targeted people.\nSEO basics - the thing that you search on Google, this is a keyword.\nTo target a keyword, simply put it in your:\n- Page title (at the beginning).\n- Meta description (at the beginning).\n- URL slug.\n- H1 (the big top heading).\n- First sentence of the page (at the beginning).\nHere are the rest of the tiny 20% of SEO things to do that gets 80% of the results .\nIf you're using video to target keywords (video ranks on Google very well ), put the keyword at the beginning of your description, write a thorough description, and if there's a title field for the video platform, also put the keyword at the beginning of that title field.\n## Example keywords\nHere's what these keywords - which represent the purchasing power of lots of people - look like.\nBottom of funnel keyword + for + plural modifier.\nModifier examples:\n- Schools\n- Districts\n- Hospitals\n- Government\n- Government employees\n- Teams\n- Enterprise companies\n- Small businesses (enough volume here to still be worth it)\n- Students\n- Lawyers\n- Accountants\n- Startups\n- Nonprofits\n- Agencies\n- Retailers\n- Universities\n- Clinics\n- Sales teams\nFull examples:\n- Asynchronous video messaging for teams\n- Cybersecurity audits for clinics\n- Standing desks for offices\n- Whiteboards for conference rooms\n- Expense tracking software for lawyers\n- Cloud storage for video production companies\n- Legal consulting for healthcare providers\n- Soundproof phone booths for offices\n- Visitor check in software for schools\n- Remote signature tool for government employees\nSEO tools will tell you that the monthly search volume for these types of keywords is low to null.\nBut that's only because we're looking at one of these keywords.\nThese keywords are so noncompetitive, when you have a page that ranks #1 for one of them, the page will also rank #1 for many other similar bottom of funnel keywords.\nThere's simply not enough pages targeting these hyper-specific purchase-intent keywords, so Google has to suggest the nearest match - which will be your page.\nAlso, your brand can satisfy multiple use cases and scenarios (your standing desk company can be used for more than just offices, for example) so you make a page targeting each distinct use case/scenario.\n## Pages\n\"Edward, are you telling me I need to put up dozens of several-thousand word pages targeting these keywords?\"\nNope!\nEach page only needs to be 400-500 words.\nOne of these pages can be made in an afternoon.\nThe critical things:\n- Make sure the above-the-fold content (what shows before you start scrolling on a page) completely says to the visitor arriving from Google that your solution is for them.\n- Use a clear H1 (as mentioned above).\n- A relevant image.\n- 3-5 sentences of introductory text about how your brand is great for this keyword.\n- A call-to-action button to reach out or try the product or make an order.\nThen, for the rest of the page, have copy that is unique to this scenario or use case. Put thought into who is searching this, their specific industry, and their specific needs. Give lots of examples.\nThis type of copy both boosts conversions and makes the page more able to rank for other similar keywords!\nBut again, not 3,000 words like has been the status quo in SEO, but only 400-500 . That's really all that is necessary .\nFinally another call-to-action button at the bottom of the page.\n## The most valuable SEO is also the easiest\nFor free, with less work than normal, this SEO gets you in front of decision-makers when they're already warm and looking for a solution.\nPurchase orders representing dozens, hundreds, or thousands of people.\nAnybody can do it, but few think to try.\nThe most valuable SEO is also the easiest.\nYou can use this email as a guide to make these pages and target these people - and if you want a more extensive resource on how to do it, my SEO course is 10 hours long + 3.5 hours of weekly examples."

It's a lot.\nHow do we cut through the noise?\nThis is my cafe trick.\n## The discovery\nA few months ago I was having a day where I was completely strapped for time.\nIt was 7:30 PM and I hadn't made my daily Reel/TikTok yet. I'm currently on 867 consecutive days, so I didn't want to break the streak.\nI stopped in a cafe and recorded this in five minutes:\n> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nA post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nRight before recording, I had no idea what my video would be about. I needed to post something so I said, \"I'll just share one of my favorite marketing tools.\"\nI almost didn't post that video. It felt too lazy. I straight up thought the video was bad .\nIn fact, I thought it was so bad, I recorded another video immediately after to make up for that lazy video.\nThe second video, where I tried harder, completely flopped.\nThat first \"lazy\" video made me that company's most successful affiliate.\n## Reproducing it\nSeveral weeks later I started thinking, \"I wonder if there's something about recording in cafes?\"\nI wrote a script.\nI went to a cafe.\nI recorded in five minutes.\nI left the cafe and returned home to edit.\nThe video got millions of views across platforms:\n> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nA post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nThe thing is I had been recording in cafes or restaurants or airports for years at this point, but it was always unintentional.\nI'm committed to not missing a day of posting and many days I didn't have time to make a video from home.\nI never really considered that recording from cafes could actually make my content more engaging.\n## Why it works and can it be faked?\nNothing's surefire and it doesn't always work, but recording from cafes has, for me, a substantially higher hit rate than recording from home.\nHere's why I believe it works:\n- I'm self-conscious when recording from a crowded cafe and as a result I'm speaking in hushed tones. Inadvertently it sounds like I'm about to share a secret . This, I believe, is the #1 thing. It's possible to fake it, but I haven't been able to just yet. Being forced to whisper seems to make viewers listen up.\n- This, I believe, is the #1 thing. It's possible to fake it, but I haven't been able to just yet. Being forced to whisper seems to make viewers listen up.\n- The ambient noise of the cafe makes it more mysterious. Again, this can be faked. Play cafe sounds combined with cafe music (both on YouTube) on a speaker to make it seem like you're in a cafe.\n- Again, this can be faked. Play cafe sounds combined with cafe music (both on YouTube) on a speaker to make it seem like you're in a cafe.\n- Just the setting of being around other people, or not home, or not in a quiet location, makes the content stand out.

All by accident.\nI recorded this (below) from a crowded cafe in Warsaw. I was literally sitting at a table with strangers directly to my right and to my left. When I recorded, people were staring.\n> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nA post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nTrick 1: Buying short memorable domains and redirecting them.\n- Giving an affiliate code greatly reduces success rate. People are lazy and they won't use the code if it doesn't give an added discount.\n- My trick is to buy short domains that are memorable, say them in my videos, and redirect them to the right places.

Really, you can take multiple top spots on Google just with video that you make in five minutes. Compare this to spending a day or a week making a page, and it's a no brainer that this is worth trying.\n- TikToks, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts also tend to rank immediately.\n- Google even stated in their recent March Core Update announcement that they \"will continue to surface more content from creators.\"\n- Videos are more likely to be indexed and rank if they get good engagement.\n- What to do: Take your keyword and put it at the beginning of the video title and beginning of the video description. Use your transcript as the rest of the video description. Edit the transcript for clarity. That's it.\n- Take your keyword and put it at the beginning of the video title and beginning of the video description. Use your transcript as the rest of the video description.

It went viral when it was originally posted. When I reposted it in October of 2023, it went viral again . I've since reposted the video many more times. Each time it continues to go viral. Since its creation that video has probably received 10-15 million views.\n- Here's a new variation on reposting: Lots of people are seeing success reposting only to Trial Reels on Instagram. Here's a Trial Reels repost of the first video shared in this article. It's getting lots of sign-ups.\n- What to do: When you have a video that does well, repost it every 3-6 months. Repost successful promotional videos to Trial Reels on Instagram as Instagram pushes the video out to people who are not following you and who are therefore less likely to have seen your videos or to remember them.\n- When you have a video that does well, repost it every 3-6 months.\n- Repost successful promotional videos to Trial Reels on Instagram as Instagram pushes the video out to people who are not following you and who are therefore less likely to have seen your videos or to remember them.\n## If you're using video to get sales\nIf you're using Instagram Reels/TikTok/YouTube Shorts to make videos selling your products or services, consider recording from a lively cafe.\nGet a nice coffee.

    "text": "This resource shares exactly how to get on podcasts as a guest - the tactics, strategies, and tools I use to get appearances. These are my learnings from months of trial and error; my wins and my losses.\nWhat I learned, and share below, worked so well that I went on over 30 podcasts in only 3 months .\nInitially, I thought about cold emailing different shows but quickly speculated there had to be tools for finding podcasts looking for guests. This hunch was right.\nThere are established podcast-matching platforms that make it easy to go on different shows remotely in a short amount of time.\nMost of this will focus on the platforms I use to go on 90% of my podcasts as well as give advice on how to use them. Then I'll share what to expect when you go on your first podcasts and how to make the most of your guest appearances.\nThe benefits of doing this are crazy.\n## How going on podcasts benefits you\nFirst, here's a quick rundown of how going on podcasts as a guest will benefit your career.\n- It's a solid way to get distribution and build top-of-mind awareness for your brand.\n- You become friends with sought-after people (podcast hosts) who connect you with more sought-after people.\n- You get an essentially never-ending stream of content to repurpose for social media.\n- Podcast appearances give you backlinks, which benefits your SEO (search engine optimization).\n- Podcasts wanting you as a guest validates your authority. Sharing your appearances on LinkedIn, X, YouTube, and TikTok lets people know your brand is in demand.\n## PodMatch\nPodMatch is the most reliable and efficient tool I've used to go on podcasts. I appear on about 70% of my podcasts through this platform and constantly recommend it.\nPros\n- Algorithmically connects you to hosts looking for guests based on similar interests.\n- There are a lot of very active hosts on the platform.\n- Connects you with several hosts a day who may be a good fit for you.\n- You can message hosts and hosts message you.\n- Inexpensive.\n- Has a leaderboard that refreshes monthly, giving everybody a fair chance.\n- Most hosts prefer remote guests.\nCons\n- No free trial or free tier.\n## MatchMaker.fm\nMatchMaker.fm is my second most used podcast-matching platform, and I go on about 20% of my shows through here.\nPros\n- Similar to PodMatch, it has thorough filters for finding shows to go on.\n- There are some very legitimate shows on MatchMaker.fm with large audiences.\n- Hosts are likelier to cold message you on here if you are an interesting guest.\n- Solicit hosts by posting in the forum and see who viewed your profile.\n- Just like PodMatch, most hosts prefer remote.\nCons\n- No free trial or free tier.\n- Fewer hosts than PodMatch.\n- I encountered some hosts who attempted to charge me for an appearance. You should never accept this!\n## Bonus: word of mouth\nThe remaining 10% of my podcast appearances come through word of mouth.\nIt turns out that getting on podcasts is like many other things in life: it becomes easier with repetition.\nThe podcast community is amazing and intertwined. Hosts are guests on others' shows, and everybody is making recommendations for guests who they feel will add value.\nIt's a lot like sales . You create relationships, people like you, and you become top-of-mind for a particular niche. As you become more dominant in this niche, people begin to make warm intros to hosts eager to have you on.\nFinally, as you go on more and more podcasts, you get access to better shows with bigger audiences. You encounter a host who knows a more successful host who you would be perfect for - and the cycle repeats.\n## Cold emailing: not an easy way\nI would absolutely not recommend cold emailing hosts.\nThis is the standard piece of advice for people who want to go on podcasts, and it is not good advice.\nCompared to the podcast-matching platforms mentioned here, it is time-consuming and wildly unreliable.\nIf you spend days messaging hosts on these podcast-matching platforms, you'll likely get a couple, or even a ton, of appearances booked.\nIf you spend days cold emailing podcast hosts, you will very possibly have nothing to show for it.\nThe only way to go on the most competitive podcasts is with word of mouth. You can get that word of mouth by going on many shows using podcast-matching platforms.\n## Should you use more podcast-matching platforms?\nThere are other podcast-matching platforms out there, but it's a better use of time to double down on the platforms mentioned in this resource.\nInstead of going on extra podcast-matching platforms, you should do these activities:\n- Improve your profile on the two platforms mentioned here: Record a better introductory video. Think more deeply about your niche. Look through the top-performing guests on PodMatch and see how they position themselves.\n- Record a better introductory video.\n- Think more deeply about your niche.\n- Look through the top-performing guests on PodMatch and see how they position themselves.\n- Spend more time looking for hosts who are highly matched to you.\n- Message more hosts on these platforms.\n- Practice your story-telling abilities if you're nervous about doing your first shows. Put in headphones. Pretend you're on a call. Say one of your favorite stories out loud.\nI went on 30 podcasts in 3 months using PodMatch and MatchMaker.fm. I easily could have gone on more if I had put more time in. Using other podcast-matching platforms would have been completely unnecessary.\n## Work on your profile!\nMost of your success appearing on podcasts through these platforms will not be determined by how great your message to hosts is.\nThe ability for you to land podcast appearances is based on your profile and niche.\nPodMatch has the most thorough profile options - I filled out everything. If you work on having a great PodMatch profile, you can simply copy and paste all your relevant details to MatchMaker.fm.\nPodMatch gives you so many matches it's essential to put some effort into your profile.\nMost people don't record an introductory video. You should absolutely do this. Put in the time to make it right, so it is as easy as possible for hosts to choose you. Here's my introductory video. I spent an hour doing multiple takes.\nHere are the rest of the things you should do for your profiles.\nPut in guest tags so the algorithms can best match you to hosts.\nMake your about section brief but sweet - two paragraphs, maximum.\nMake your biography section long and interesting. Keep paragraphs no more than two sentences.\nWrite questions for hosts to ask you - many podcast-matching platforms require this.\nWork on an engaging headline. My current one is \"Self-development addict and entrepreneur traveling around the world.\"\nPut in some good high-quality images hosts can use for your show's thumbnails.\n## How to message hosts\nWhen you message a host on a podcast-matching platform, the rule of thumb is to keep it short and sweet.\nYour profile - tagline, introductory video, and about sections - are going to do the talking for you.\nSay why you like the host's podcast and why you think you will be a good guest. Your host will then look at your profile and see that you're a good fit. Below is an example.\n## Deciding which podcasts to go on\nA lot of guests who are starting out don't realize there are podcast ranking tools out there like Listen Notes , which give an idea of a podcast's popularity.\nThrough these tools, you can see which podcasts are most popular and choose to spend your time on the top ones over the ones that don't have large audiences.\nHowever, my philosophy on this is beggars can't be choosers. Not everybody can land Joe Rogan as their first booking. If you aren't very notable, you can still go on podcasts as somebody who is charismatic, but you may not be able to get the top gigs at first.\nFor me, going on any podcast is fun. I enjoy it, and for that reason I say yes to everybody. When I go on a show, it's a party. I love it.\nAs I wrote earlier, I also firmly believe that good appearances on small shows will lead to opportunities to appear on bigger shows. The podcast community is smaller than people realize and hosts talk. If you consistently give good appearances, you'll be recommended to bigger and bigger shows.\n## Do you need a professional podcast microphone?\nYou absolutely do not need a professional podcast microphone. Many hosts care far more about the quality of a guest's conversations and stories than they do the quality of the guest's sound.\nI went on nearly all my podcasts using this $13 pair of headphones . After going on a few podcasts, I tried buying a professional microphone for $25 (the one in my video). This more expensive microphone didn't sound great compared to my headphones, so I returned to them.\nBut I can say from experience hosts are way more concerned with the quality of your stories, knowledge, adventures, and engagement than they are with the crispness of your voice.\n## What to expect when you land your first podcast guest bookings\nWhen I did my first podcast appearance, I was nervous. I was a tadpole and I had no idea what to expect. Now I know.\n### The vetting interview\nExpect for hosts to interview you in advance to make sure you're a good fit for their shows.\nHosts will use this interview to flesh out topics for the show and to ensure they can vibe with you.\nI've never not passed one of these interview sessions. I try to have genuine conversations with the hosts and enjoy my time talking to them. I often hear, \"Wow, okay, it's clear we could keep talking for hours. This show is going to be great.\"\nIf you enjoy talking and meeting people, you'll do very well.\nMy secret : Don't look at this as a job interview. Instead look at it as an opportunity to have an enjoyable conversation with somebody you may end up becoming friends with.\n### Hosts are busy\nIt's very common for hosts to be booked for weeks or months in advance. Once you have the vetting interview, you may wait another couple of weeks before doing the podcast.\nIf there is no vetting interview, you still may wait weeks or months before doing a podcast.\n### Record in a good place\nI learned this the hard way. You'll want to record in a quiet place with decent lighting.\nA hack for lighting is just to have a bright light in your face. With this said, lighting isn't super important as not many shows are video-heavy. However, recording in a quiet place is critical.\nYou'll also want to make sure you have a stable Internet connection.\n### The pre-show chat\nHosts will usually warm themselves and their guests up before the recording with a preshow chat.\nThis chat is used to get the conversation flowing and to reduce any tension.\nThese chats can last anywhere from 5-15 minutes.\n### The recording\nExpect for hosts to introduce you and/or for you to have introduce yourself. I introduce myself on a lot of shows; it has become second nature at this point.\nAnything is a conversation path, so your introduction can also kickstart the conversation.\nSome hosts may have planned questions that they want to ask you. Go with the flow, enjoy speaking, and enjoy the company of the host.\nThe typical podcast is 50 minutes in length, but this is highly variable. I've gone on shows that were 30 minutes, and I've gone on shows that were 2 hours. The average is 50 minutes but there's no one size fits all.\nAn example showing one of my podcast appearances.\n### The post-show chat\nI'll often continue talking to hosts when the show ends. Sometimes I'll even talk with a host for up to an hour after the show ends.\nThese times are the winding down of a great conversation and the tying up of any loose ends of production. Hosts will ask questions about how they should refer to you in the written podcast description and double check they have the right links for you.\nI'll even take hosts' phone numbers during this period because we have such an engaging chat that hosts want to stay in touch.\n### Shows can take a while to be released\nWhile the release time of a show is often much shorter than the wait time to appear on one, expect for there to be a bit of a delay between the recording and the release.\nHosts will want to edit shows and write in timestamps for different points in the podcast.\n## How to get the most from your podcast appearances.\nLeveraging your podcast appearances is arguably the most important part of going on them. You don't want your recordings to go to waste, and each appearance has a lot of potential for how it can be used.\nHere's a checklist for how to make the most of your podcast guest appearances:\n- Share your podcast appearances on LinkedIn and X. You want your community to feel the momentum you're building. This will lead to opportunities to go on more podcasts and general opportunities for your brand and your business.\n- Repurpose your content into short-form videos for mobile. These include YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and TikTok. You can use tools like Descript to save tons of time with editing.\n- If there is a brand you're doing SEO for, or think you'll want to do SEO for, have the podcast link to your brand . Podcasts are great for building SEO domain authority and can help a lot with getting relevant search traffic. Don't neglect this.\n- Stay in touch with the hosts! Podcast hosts are very connected people. Check in from time to time to stay top-of-mind with them and see how they're doing. On any given day, they may come across somebody who would find your brand useful or informative.\n## Conclusion\nYou should not be cold emailing podcast hosts. Instead, you should be using podcast-matching platforms.\nPodMatch is the number one platform I've used.\nMatchMaker.fm is the runner-up.\nThese two platforms alone will get you all the appearances you need, and I've appeared on dozens of shows in a short amount of time through them.\nMake a thorough profile and enjoy sharing your life on some podcasts! As you grow in popularity, don't forget to track each appearance and leverage it upon release.\nHave any questions or comments?

The information they give you is super relevant, super fresh, and they're trying to help you because they just spent money with you.\nThis also makes people enjoy your product more because they qualify themselves. \"They feel like they've contributed to your business, so now they're more invested in seeing you win.\"\n\"It works every time. This is responsible for 6 of our 10 biggest wins over the last four or five years. We literally implement this on all of our stores [over 300 of them]. \"\n## Three podcasts\nI got a bit too excited with this article and jumped into it before even giving an explanation.\nOver the last week I had three guests on my podcast.\nYesterday, Matthew Stafford , who's been doing conversion rate optimization for over a decade, came on. The advice above is from him. He says of it, \"What the customer gives us is way different than what the owner [who we're working with] believes we need to see.\"\nIn fact, that advice was so good I literally put it into my SEO Program, Compact Keywords, immediately after finishing the recording:\nThis comes directly after the Compact Keywords thank you page.\nTuesday, Bill Hartzer , a legend in SEO who's been a well-known figure in the industry for 25 years, came on the show.\nLast weekend, Keida Dervishi , who, at 19-years-old, had her IG/TikTok-driven ecom business break 7 figures, came on. Now, at 23, she's doing many millions a year and has 20 people working for her.\nHere are four more needle movers I got from these people.\n## Turning one-time customers into repeat customers\nIn addition to that simple one question mentioned above, the customer also receives a post-purchase survey email.\nIn exchange for filling out the survey within 48 hours of purchasing, the customer gets a gift card/discount to come back and buy more on the site.\n\" What we thought we were doing was buying data,\" Matthew told me. \"What we found is these people came back and bought more within seven days, which is quicker than even their shipping times. And over time, these customers are about four or five times more valuable than the average customer.\"\nCrazy, right?\nThe questions in the survey are things like:\n- \"What can you tell us about yourself?\"\n- \"How many other sites did you look at for \"x product\" before buying from us? Which ones? \"\n- \"What made you choose our site?\"\n- All survey questions and a lot more are shared here (and yes, Matthew gave me permission to share this).\nTo me, this is an insane hack. You get more data and when people give it to you, it makes them MORE LIKELY to buy more from you.\nTo listen to the full podcast with Matthew Stafford (with so many more of these bangers), it's here:\n## One of the craziest Local SEO shortcuts\nBill Hartzer has done countless SEO experiments.\nOne of the things he's found is that when people search your business on Google Maps, use the directions feature to go to it, and actually go to it, your business is more likely to appear high on Google Maps for its keywords.\nAs a result, tons of methods have been developed for gaming this, such as this black hat trick .\nBut is there a way to exploit this that is not against Google's guidelines?\nThere is.\nGiveaways.\nHere's how it goes:\n- Local Instagram accounts and local newsletters constantly need local information to share with their followers & subscribers. Some charge a small advertising fee, others don't.\n- You have a giveaway or huge discount.\n- It's announced to the local IGs and newsletters.\n- Lots of people who haven't previously been exposed to your business see this, put your business name into Google Maps, use directions, and go to your business.\n- You have great customer service so you get the added benefit of lots of positive reviews.\n- The high amount of people searching and going to your business + the reviews make local rankings increase .\nHear Bill Hartzer talk more about this here:\n## High frequency posting lifestyle\nKeida Dervishi is basically doing the Build in Public trend with her ecom business.\nBuild in Public is a movement that originated years ago on SaaS Twitter starting with Pieter Levels .\nThe concept is easy to understand: you build your business in public and share everything: successes, failures, learnings, tests, iterations, revenue, etc.\nKeida Dervishi is doing most of this, posting seven times a day.\nShe's mostly sharing orders she got, her reactions, and making the items that were ordered - a version of Build in Public.\nEach video she makes also sells the product. Like this one, which received 70 million views : https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2x3cSwPRrx/\nShe's not making silly dance videos or news videos that don't sell. She is going viral with sales videos. Super impactful. She's posting 7x per day and making millions of dollars per year.\nHere's how she posts 7x/day:\n- She makes her videos in the TikTok app (very easy and fast). You can use this tool to make your videos auto-release from TikTok to every channel.\n- You can use this tool to make your videos auto-release from TikTok to every channel.\n- She closes her eyes when searching for trending sounds on the FYP (if she doesn't close her eyes, the FYP will distract her and cost her too much time).\n- She wakes up at 5 AM. Exercises, eats well, in bed by 8-9 PM. Disciplined.\n- She's also partly doing operations so her time is very valuable. She has her calendar planned weeks in advance to the minute.\n- She barely looks at comments. She posts, then makes more content.\n- She has standard formats she does, like reaction formats, or standard hooks she uses like the one in the above viral video.\nI'm at 860 consecutive days of posting videos so from one creator to another, Keida was awesome to talk to. She shared so much good stuff. You can hear it all here:\n## How to make people more likely to convert\nI asked Matthew Stafford what he puts in his checkout section.\nMost people just have a plain checkout area with nothing else. Here's what Matthew puts:\n- How many customers the business served or how long they've been in business.\n- High quality reviews, especially ones that address common objections.\n- The biggest thing was a phone number. It builds trust. Very few people actually use it, they just like to see it. The people who do use it are literally about to purchase, they just need one thing answered.\n- It builds trust.\n- Very few people actually use it, they just like to see it.\n- The people who do use it are literally about to purchase, they just need one thing answered.\nThank you again to Keida , Bill , and Matthew for coming on the pod!\n## Compact Keywords\nYears ago, before making the Compact Keywords program, I showed the results to my old mentor who, at the time, was Head of SEO at Omnicom. Omnicom is the 2nd largest publicly traded marketing agency, ranked by market cap.\nThe results I was getting were so outstanding, I was asked to teach the method to Omnicom's SEOs.\nIf you like these articles, my podcast, or my mobile videos, you're going to like Compact Keywords.\nIt's a comprehensive video course along with my personal SEO templates showing how to do this method of SEO.\nAnd you don't need to work at Omnicom to get it.\nIt's only $499.\nEvery 20 minutes of Compact Keywords was 7 hours of preparation, production, and reviewing from me. And the program is 10 hours long, plus an additional 15 weekly keyword breakdowns. So the time to make it added up.\nThis wasn't a weekend product, Compact Keywords took me 11 months to make.\nYou can get it now here .\nThank you for reading."

    "text": "Four quick hacks to increase email open rates for newsletters, email lists, and more.\nThe average newsletter open rate is 15-25%. HubSpot says \"a solid one is 20+% .\" My AI DeepSearch says 15-25% .\nMy open rates for my weekly newsletter average between ~2-3 times that. 40-70%.\nHere's why I think this is, which anybody can copy.\n## One-word subject lines\nThis is the most important, I believe.\nI deliberately use one-word subject lines.\nMy lowest open rates, by far, have subject lines with more than one word. And the longer the subject line, I've found, the lower the open rate.\nThis is an easy one to implement, which for me, makes a difference of 10% or more (yes, it's that dramatic).\n## My welcome automation\nImmediately after subscribing to my newsletter , everybody gets the same welcome email.\nSubject line, one word: \"Hey\"\nBody:\nShoutout to Karen Salmansohn who broke down why this works so well:\nI started doing this to keep my emails out of the spam/promotion folder but found that, like Karen said, this welcome email had all those other benefits.\nWorth mentioning:\n- While the welcome email is automatic, I personally respond to everyone, asking about their business, the freelancing/work they do, or what they study. I've thought about using AI for this, but many people respond with more than just a letter, and responding manually allows me to keep a pulse on who's attracted to my newsletter and what they're looking for.\n- One day after the welcome email, I also have another automatic email go out, with five actionable marketing hacks anybody can implement. I tried hard to make that email a banger to set a high expectation with the newsletter, further boosting open rates.\n## Consistency\nEverybody. EVERYBODY. Everybody says it.\nOne of the biggest drivers of newsletter success is consistency.\nLike everything else I do (I'm at 854 consecutive days making a TikTok/IG Reel and 606 consecutive days putting up a podcast), I'm incredibly consistent with my newsletter .\nBenefits of consistency with a newsletter:\n- Your writing style and techniques improve (my newsletter did not start with one-word subject lines).\n- You're forced to explore topics more. You become better at doing and explaining them. Few people become excellent and many people recognize excellence.\n## Culling the herd\nThe last time I did this was January 2024, over one year ago. I culled the herd.\n\"List cleaning\" is a thing for a reason.\nAside from reducing costs if your email marketing plan involves paying for subscribed contacts, list cleaning improves open rates.\nLots of email providers like Gmail or Outlook monitor engagement. Low engagement makes emails more likely to go to spam or the promotions tab.\nWhat I did one year ago was very simple:\n- Segmented my list into people who haven't opened an email in the last three months.\n- Sent an email to these people saying, \"I'm cleaning my list and my email marketing provider says you haven't opened my emails in the last three months. If this isn't true, please click this button to remain on the list.\"\n- Gave these people 1.5 months to click the button.\n- Archived all contacts who did not click the button.\nThat's four very easy things you can do to increase open rates and have more people read your messages.\nThank you for reading!\n## Compact Keywords\nThis email open rate guide was originally written for my newsletter.\nLike any great resource, I try to make the newsletter dense with useful info and little fluff.\nAnd while I'm certainly not always perfect, that is my goal for all my content.\nFor those who don't know I just released an SEO Program, Compact Keywords, about how to use SEO to get paying customers, users, and warm leads to your business.\nHere's a review I got a few days ago:\n\" I'm currently in the 'On Site SEO' section. I'm already so glad I paid the money. Each lesson is DENSE with information. I knew a little bit about SEO beforehand, but I still get so much out of each lesson. You're giving years' worth of experience boiled down into 15-30 minute lessons, with no filler or fluff. I feel like I'm gaining a new superpower. \"\nThank you Jason Leibler of Fit & Function Therapy for the review.\nTo check it out, Compact Keywords is available at https://compactkeywords.com/"

I downloaded it.\nI dropped it into Descript so I could edit it with the transcript:\nThis is a principle of life for any marketer, creator, or builder.\nWe are least objective after first making something.\nIn my case, when I first made that video, the small tweaks to improve it were staring me RIGHT IN THE FACE. But I was so in love with my creation, I couldn't see it.\nWith a year's time (and of course more experience), I was able to view the original through clear eyes.\nHere are the small tweaks that were made:\n- The long introduction was cut. It was a better hook to start with a close up of the dog in the suit along with the scenario, than to introduce the dog and the scenario.\n- The word \"previously\" was removed. This word probably confused people because most viewers, even your biggest fans, haven't seen or won't remember all your content.\n- Captions were added. Captions make videos easier to consume. They also help viewers watching on mute or low volume. This is especially applicable to Instagram viewers scrolling through their timeline, with their volume off.\n- Trending music was added (the original had no music). As I share here , when you upload a video to TikTok, TikTok uses AI to analyze your video and recommend the perfect trending sound. I literally just picked the top recommendation from TikTok.\n- A different thumbnail was used - an even more interesting image of the dog, taken from the end of the video. I think , but I'm not sure, this increased clicks in Instagram's Explore page. However, the video performed very well on TikTok too, which barely relies on thumbnails, so I don't think the thumbnail mattered much.\nThat was it. Five tiny tweaks. A 683,660% increase in views. 1,400 new followers. A viral piece of content I can repost for years to get more new followers and top-of-mind awareness.\n## Is your business a block of stone yet to find its beautiful sculpture?\nCompact Keywords shows you how to target people searching Google or AI chatbots (as I show here, my SEO pages rank on AI ) for whatever it is you are selling.\n- Get direct customers, users, or warm leads\n- Far faster than traditional SEO\n- Less work than traditional SEO (less backlinks, less copy, no more 3,000 word blog posts).\nCompact Keywords is a full 0 to 100 SEO course made for beginners with no experience, or even veterans using outdated SEO strategies which no longer work.\nIn addition to an extensive main program, Compact Keywords has 15 weekly keyword and SEO landing page breakdowns ranging from ecommerce, local, services, SaaS, and everything in between.\nIt took me 3 years and $350,000 to learn this strategy and I'm giving it to you in Compact Keywords for $1199, but now with an early release discount which makes the total price $499 .\nThis strategy is being used by experts working at or consulting companies like Microsoft, Anduril, Slack, Calendly, Salesforce, Deloitte, Omnicom, Shein, Amazon, tons of local businesses, burgeoning startups, and so much more.\nIt's available at https://compactkeywords.com/\nYou're going to love it."

I run a 7-figure meme empire and I will go to any means (or memes ) necessary to get views and make internet moolah!\nAnd sometimes yes, that means taking advantage of a celebrity's death.\nYes I'm ashamed to admit it. This week, I took advantage of a death to go viral and make money. I'm definitely going to Hell. But Hell is more fun anyways. Plus it's a good marketing tactic that you can do too anytime somebody famous dies.\n\"WAIT, who died this week???,\" you wonder.\nWell, a little green owl named Duo.\n## The Death of Duo, the Duolingo Owl\nOn Tuesday, February 11th, 2025 Duo the Owl died.\nDuolingo was pulling a genius publicity stunt building off their mascot everyone knows and loves. It was blowing up the internet. Everyone was talking about. So when I saw this press announcement was going viral, I hatched a plan:\nSo that same Tuesday, I cancelled my meetings, drank a Red Bull, and started cooking.\nIn just a couple hours and a Red Bull, I built a free brand mascot generator where anyone could build their own goofy mascot. And the best part? I made it free as a lead magnet for my meme software Memelord Technologies .\nHere's some of the mascots people have come up with:\nRed Bull Builder\nPissed Off Penguin\nBirthday Cake Cooking\nMeditative Memelord Monkey\nWait why would I do this for free?\nDon't I have to pay like API fees or something....?\nYes, but it's worth it. Let me explain.\n## The rise of \"Free Tool Marketing\"\nNow that software is easier than ever to build thanks to AI and no-code, free tools rather than guides, PDFs, and e-books are quickly becoming the norm for lead magnets.\nI wrote a full Guide to Free Tool Marketing for HubSpot's blog in January. But the idea is simple: you find something people are searching in your niche with low keyword difficulty and then build a free tool as a lead magnet to your paid software. I did this with \"meme png\", built a free meme png creator, and see signups everyday. I did this with \"Valentines Day Memes\" and built a free Valentine's Day Meme Generator . I'm always trying to cook up free new tools for my memelords.\nSo that's exactly what I did with brand mascot generator.\nI built my brand mascot generator as a way to get people on my site and then saw signups for my paid software. Because of the Duolingo aspect, I was going to build it whether or not it had low keyword difficulty-but I looked on Ahrefs and it turned out the keyword difficulty was super low for \"brand mascot\"! Double win!\nMy personal belief: There's no excuse anymore why you're not building software with how fast it can be done these days. I'm non-technical and I cook up all my own software with Red Bull, no-code, and YouTube!\n## Ok so what happened next????\nOnce I had the mascot generator done, I wrote a breakdown of Duolingo's publicity stunt.\n> > be Duolingo > post tweet saying your mascot died > mention Dua Lipa at the end (they sound similar) > get 69M views on statement > get a Dua Lipa quote-tweet > big brands like Netflix and Halo quote-tweet > search interest hits all-time high > post tweet saying \"In lieu of... pic.twitter.com/iceWvPUm6N - Jason Levin (@iamjasonlevin) February 12, 2025\n> be Duolingo > post tweet saying your mascot died > mention Dua Lipa at the end (they sound similar) > get 69M views on statement > get a Dua Lipa quote-tweet > big brands like Netflix and Halo quote-tweet > search interest hits all-time high > post tweet saying \"In lieu of... pic.twitter.com/iceWvPUm6N\nThat breakdown got 178,500 views.\nAnd as the post was blowing up, I dropped my mascot generator in the tweet below. That 2nd tweet alone has 14,000 views and 400+ link clicks.\nUnder the 2nd mascot Tweet, I kept adding to the tweetstorm!\nI showed people all the cool mascots people came up with. Then I made some silly memes on my software with my mascot to show people all the cool creative stuff you can do with a mascot. Then I went Edward Mode and recorded a video and even dropped that in the tweetstorm ! I did all of this to get people to go check out the brand mascot generator I cooked up in 2 hours with a Red Bull!\nAll made with Memelord Technologies\nOn top of tons of traffic and signups, I got:\n- 100s of new followers on X (NICE)\n- Someone at Duolingo reached out and said they loved the post (BOOM!)\n- Someone at a public company reached out to mention me in a blog (SEO juice!)\n- A good story to tell my grandkids about how I leveraged a fake owl's death on my route to making generational wealth from dank memes\nAll in a few hours work and some Red Bull.\nYou can literally just do things.\nMan I love the internet."

    "text": "'Best of' lists are back, and Google is changing.\nHere's a TL;DR of this article : It's now easy again to rank on Google for keywords like \"Best organic peanut butter\" or \"Best AI automation consulting companies\" if the \"best of\" keyword is directly in your niche. This is how to do it in 2025.\n## Google is changing\nOriginal small blogs that were devastated by recent Google updates (which fell into Google's Helpful Content Update ) are making a comeback.\nCheck these out:\nSource: https://x.com/indexsy/status/1887248520568315948\nSource: https://x.com/zrkann/status/1887182395692183702\n## Meanwhile Google just announced\nMeanwhile Google's Gary Illyes just announced at an event, \"Originality is something we're going to be focusing on this year. That's going to be important.\"\n## 'Best of' lists\nBefore I get to what originality means, let's go to \"best of\" keywords.\nEverybody's done it - wanted something and searched on Google for \"best [whatever you wanted].\" I've done it too even though it's pretty much the dumbest thing you could do.\nFor the most part, the websites that show up have extreme self interests at play. It's not who is best, it's who knows how to do SEO.\nBut by sharing how to do it, I think more of the sites that deserve it will show up.\nFor example - I recently spoke to a customer of my SEO Program, Compact Keywords . He just started ranking for a best of list in his niche. Of course he said on the list he was the best in his category. But, when I spoke to him, it was clear he really cared.\nThat's actually a big reason why Google hit all these small blogs in the first place. A lot of them were pure SEO affiliate monetization plays from people with no actual experience in the niche - people who didn't really care .\nAnd all their sites looked the same - they didn't come off as original .\n## My take on what originality means\nMy take on what originality means - given I constantly rank with white hat methods.\nI'm just going to fire off a general bullet list.\n- Don't build spammy backlinks - or make sure your agency isn't. Instead use niche directories , meetups , podcasts , expert quotes - and places where your links will actually be clicked . For the more advanced people reading - having a hyper-natural backlink profile is becoming even more important.\n- Instead use niche directories , meetups , podcasts , expert quotes - and places where your links will actually be clicked . For the more advanced people reading - having a hyper-natural backlink profile is becoming even more important.\n- For the more advanced people reading - having a hyper-natural backlink profile is becoming even more important.\n- Stay away from AI generated text. If you decide to use it, make sure it's heavily human-edited.\n- Prioritize search intent above everything. When targeting a keyword, think about what searchers are actually looking to achieve with their search. Give that in your pages as soon as possible. Shockingly, Most SEOs don't actually put thought into their pages like this. So by doing this, you stand out.\n- Shockingly, Most SEOs don't actually put thought into their pages like this. So by doing this, you stand out.\n- Add differentiators to your page titles. Don't just call your page, \"Best Houston Window Cleaners.\" Call it, \"Best Houston Window Cleaners | Fast & Quiet Cleaning\"\n- Give searchers their answers as soon as possible. I started using TL;DRs at the top of my posts, like I did with this article. Most SEO spammers try to hold their searchers hostage to maximize time on page. They do this with a lot of fluff content at the top of a page, making visitors scroll and scroll to find what they're looking for.\n- Most SEO spammers try to hold their searchers hostage to maximize time on page. They do this with a lot of fluff content at the top of a page, making visitors scroll and scroll to find what they're looking for.\n- Give actual deep answers that show you know what you're talking about. Again, most SEOs don't actually do this. They usually give surface-level answers that leave visitors feeling dissatisfied.\n- Again, most SEOs don't actually do this. They usually give surface-level answers that leave visitors feeling dissatisfied.\nNow for those who disagree, there's nuance to all of this. I shared the above on TikTok yesterday and some guy said, \"I run several SEO spam websites with ChatGPT API with like 20 articles / site / day and they thrive, lol. Clearly the update is not working as intended.\"\nAnd my response:\n- That stuff is risky. The results can and do disappear at any time and get all the person's Google Search Console properties banned . If you're super savvy, go for it, but even then I see wayyyy more money in building a long term legit brand. Way more money.\n- Super savvy SEOs still get hit all the time. A friend who's been doing black hat SEO for several decades got hit a few months ago. He invested a ton into his website and here's what happened:\n- Like I said, I constantly rank with white hat methods that won't get my companies Google-penalized - the same methods I share for free in my newsletter and my articles .\n## And how to rank for 'Best of' keywords\nThe crazy thing is, these best of keywords get so much monthly search volume, that even if you rank at the bottom of page one or the top of page two, you'll still get conversions. And these rankings are straightforward to achieve doing what's below.\nThis isn't just theory. The customer from earlier in the story is making thousands of dollars a month from SEO with his best of list which is at the top of Google's page two. It's a newly-published article, too, so I'd expect its ranking to only increase.\nHere's how to rank for them:\n- Be original, as mentioned above. This differentiates you from the spammers.\n- Make the best of list for the current year and update it every year. \"For 2025,\" \"For 2026,\" etc. People want recency.\n- Put your target best of keyword in the: Page title Meta description URL H1 Beginning of the first sentence\n- Page title\n- Meta description\n- URL\n- H1\n- Beginning of the first sentence\n- How about page length? Consumers don't want \"100 of the best recommendations.\" That causes decision fatigue. Give them 3 or 4 or 5, but make the recommendations in-depth. This demonstrates you did your research and know what you're talking about.\n- If you want to go advanced, add the target year to the URL Slug. Every year change the URL Slug and 301 redirect the old article to the new article.\n- Have a site with niche relevance to the best of keyword. This means: Backlinks from places in your niche - the backlink strategies above cover this. A lot of content on the site around your niche - makes it clear as day this website is about this niche.\n- Backlinks from places in your niche - the backlink strategies above cover this.\n- A lot of content on the site around your niche - makes it clear as day this website is about this niche.\nThat's it! Also make sure your site meets the minimum technical requirements to be indexed. That's easy.\nGoogle is changing and that's how you rank for best of keywords in your niche!\nFor more SEO that actually converts: https://compactkeywords.com/ (or start with the review that Compact Keywords just got )."

    "text": "Four things that will be super useful to anybody doing social media marketing, search engine optimization, or, like me, both.\nBTW, if you like this article, please share with friends!\n## 1. TikTok gives reminders\nAssuming TikTok stays around in the U.S. this is going to be huge.\nThis is what I see when I open my Inbox in TikTok:\nRight next to my profile picture is \"On this day.\"\nIf you've never used On this day, it's incredible.\nIt shows you all your videos made on your current day EACH YEAR.\nIt prompts you to repost a video with the caption on the video \"On this day + DATE.\"\nHere's how I've started using this in my workflow.\nFirst, as I wrote in last week's article, Instagram rewards you for posting more. I shared the guy who posts 100x/day and gets 9.2 billion organic monthly impressions. I shared the guy who grew from 0-1 million followers in 2 months posting 12x/day. I shared that the fastest I grew by far was when I was posting 6x/day. I shared other examples (you can read it all here ).\nThrough my Repurpose automation ( see 4.4 on this list ), my videos, which come out everywhere, are automatically backed up without the TikTok watermark to Google Drive. The filename is the first couple of words of the TikTok video.\nEvery morning, I open \"On this day.\" I look for videos I want to repost. Sometimes, contextually, it makes sense to repost with TikTok's \"On this day\" added in the video. Most times though, that worsens the video.\nI go to Google Drive. I search, \"type:video after:2024-02-01 before:2024-02-03\" - videos posted after a date and before another. I find the videos I want to repost. I download them from my Google Drive. I airdrop them to my phone.\nI repost them with new captions/descriptions to TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube Shorts. Reposting works excellently on Instagram, very well on TikTok, and mildly decent on YouTube Shorts.\nSometimes there will be a video that is good enough , but parts of it will be outdated.\nI put the video into my video editor, remove the outdated parts, and it's good as new. As long as the subject matter is useful or entertaining, it still does well.\nLiterally this morning, before 9 AM, I already had two videos reposted which I originally posted one year ago. People forgot about them. One of them , posted an hour ago, is already up to 10,000 views. I reposted this a few days ago, so far it's up to 135,000 views. I reposted this on TikTok this week - it's up to nearly 300,000 views.\nIf people liked it once, they'll like it again .\n## 2. Putting keywords in the critical places.\nPeople underestimate how easy SEO is.\nSomebody from my SEO Program went after a way more competitive keyword than I typically recommend... and he ranked on the first page of Google immediately, surprising even me.\nThe reality of SEO is:\n- Most people don't have a target keyword.\n- People who have a target keyword either don't put it in the right places, or overuse it altogether.\nOne of my favorite articles is Pareto SEO: The 20% of SEO That Gets 80% of the Results .\nBut I'm going to give you the Pareto of that article. I'm giving you the Pareto OF THE PARETO.\nHave a target keyword and put it:\n- At the beginning of the Page Title and add something after that makes your Page Title different from others. Example : NYC Website Migration SEO Services | Migrate Without Losing Traffic | Sturm Media. \"NYC Website Migration SEO Services\" is the keyword. \"Migrate Without Losing Traffic\" is the extra bit to show searchers this page understands them (this increases CTR). \"Sturm Media\" is the brand name.\n- \"NYC Website Migration SEO Services\" is the keyword. \"Migrate Without Losing Traffic\" is the extra bit to show searchers this page understands them (this increases CTR). \"Sturm Media\" is the brand name.\n- At the beginning of the meta description.\n- In the URL slug.\n- In the H1.\n- At the beginning of the first sentence.\n- Don't spread it throughout the rest of the page unless it is relevant .\nThat's it.\nThat's the 20% of the 20% of SEO that gets results.\n## 3. You can do SEO without a website\nIn 1. I shared reposting year-old videos with different captions/descriptions.\nIf you're sleeping on just how great videos are for SEO, here's an image to wake you up:\nYes, that's me ranking for 3/4 TOP SPOTS on NORMAL GOOGLE SEARCH.\nThat screenshot is from this article , BTW.\nHere's what to do:\n- For any video you post (or repost) put your target keyword at the beginning of the caption/description field.\n- And, if it's YouTube Shorts, at the beginning of the Title field.\nYou can literally use the same video, reposted, to rank on Google for multiple keywords. Insane.\n## 4. Buying domains to share long URLs\nMy newsletter got a lot of new subscribers this week.\nMy SEO Program got a lot of new sales this week.\nWhy?\nBecause I made each of them easy to share with short memorable URLs in my videos.\nI bought edwardslink.com - that goes to https://edwardsturm.com/newsletter/\nI bought compactkeywords.com - that goes to https://edwardsturm.com/compact-keywords/\nAt the end of this video with 141,000 total views, I say: \"I share hacks like this in my newsletter every week at edwardslink.com.\"\nAt the end of this video with 106,000 total views, I say: \"I just put out a product on this at compactkeywords.com.\"\nHow much worse would the conversion rates of those videos be if I had given the long full URLs? A lot worse. Even putting the URLs in the descriptions - TikTok and Instagram both don't allow clickable URLs in descriptions - not a good solution either.\nTwo more examples.\nI only do affiliate videos for products I would promote anyway that just happen to have an affiliate program.\nI'm the biggest affiliate for these two products:\nAipodcastmatcher.com - shared in this recent video with 1.5 million views across platforms.\nReusevideo.com - shared in this video (and reposted for years) with 10-15 million views over its lifetime.\nIf I had given my full affiliate URL with all the random numbers and parameters, I wouldn't convert at all .\nBuying domain names and redirecting them (you can do this with your domain registrar) solves this completely and makes it so much easier to get conversions with video.\n## That's it!\nHope you enjoyed this! I always try to write short articles, get obsessed with giving everyone the most accurate nuanced details so you can copy these strategies, and end up writing essays.\nIf you like this, please share with a friend/colleague \nOr check out my SEO Program, Compact Keywords , which is getting tons of people crazy results, and will get you results too."

    "text": "This is results backed - how often to post on Instagram - data collected in early 2025 and late 2024.\nTL;DR: The more you post (literally even 100 times a day), the more visibility and followers you get.\nIs there such a thing as posting too much on Instagram?\nI used to think yes.\nThen I saw this:\n> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Instant Bollywood (@instantbollywood)\nA post shared by Instant Bollywood (@instantbollywood)\nParaphrasing what's in that video: \"I post 100 times a day on Instagram... Facebook told us we could do it... They said we can post ~10 pieces of content every hour.\"\nOkay, but does this get results?\nIf you didn't watch the Reel, I want you to guess how many impressions a month that account gets.\nHonestly, before seeing that Reel, I would have thought this behavior would get an account banned. Or shadow-banned at least.\nTurns out the account was rewarded.\n120,000+ posts in its lifetime.\n31.5 million followers.\n9.2 billion impressions in the last 30 days.\n## But is this a one-off thing? Will this work for anybody?\nFirst, it's important to note you need to warm up to it. There's a 30-60 post warm-up period on Instagram for new accounts. There's likely also a small minimum account age requirement weighted by posting frequencies.\nThe most important part though is to go slow at first and warm up.\nPost once a day.\nThen twice.\nThen 4 times.\nEtc.\nNow the most important part - will this work for other niches?\nThe niche in the opening story is a Bollywood account - @InstantBollywood - posting paparazzi footage of Indian celebrities.\nBut I've seen this everywhere.\nI tried six times a day in late 2024.\nI started growing by thousands of followers a day - and my niche is SEO & growth hacking.\n@viralvideo.club said, \"The fastest I ever grew was 135,000 followers in a single month. And guess what? I was posting three times per day. Now I'm posting between six and seven times per week. And in the last 30 days, I've grown about 85,000 followers. And I saw this impact immediately. As soon as I started posting less, I got less followers. So over the course of a month, I was gaining 50,000 less followers.\"\nThis Entrepreneur account told me:\n\"With a new account, I grew to 650,000 followers in 56 days. I was posting 4x a day.\"\n@ChatGPTricks , a very big account, did the same thing to grow fast.\nAnd this is my favorite example. This guy grew from 0 to 2 million followers in 2 months posting 12 times a day.\n## The lessons\nI want to preface this with - even if you're posting a lot, only a fraction of your followers will see your posts.\nThis woman was trying to post 100x a day. She received a comment, \"I'll unfollow if someone posts more than five times a day!\" She responded, \"You probably won't know the account posted 100 times because the Instagram algorithm will only push posts to your feed based on your responses, not all at once.\" My experience and the experience of my friends mirror this.\nSo here are the biggest lessons:\n- You get rewarded for posting a lot on Instagram.\n- You don't just get more followers, you get more visibility - more impressions on your brand or whatever you're promoting.\n- The craziest thing - and this was from my first-hand experience - the more I posted, the more impressions subsequent posts would get. Higher posting frequency was boosting the visibility of all my Reels posted in that period. My guess is because the more I posted, the more unhinged and authentic I became. So posting a lot actually made my posts (mostly Reels) more engaging .\n- My guess is because the more I posted, the more unhinged and authentic I became. So posting a lot actually made my posts (mostly Reels) more engaging .\n## How to get inspiration for what to post\nFirst thing to know - motion creates emotion. A month ago I procrastinated for an hour by texting my friends how much I really didn't want to make a video that day. I had done over 800 consecutive days in a row making a video and knew I wasn't going to miss that day, but I just did not want to do it . Then I forced myself to.\nThe first video of that day was meh, but I felt more loose. I saw a big announcement about ChatGPT and immediately made a second video about it. Then I felt a lot better and made a third video about SEO. Then I realized my second video should have used a different hook so I quickly made a fourth video. And that video, my fourth one of the day, went viral with around 6 million views. Motion creates emotion.\nSecond thing. Reels perform best on Instagram, but it doesn't just have to be Reels. It can also be image posts or carousels. The accounts that are posting frequently do a mix. I post at least one video a day, however.\nThird thing. If there's ever anything in your niche so interesting or cool or emotionally charged that you feel the need to share it with a colleague... make a video about it first. Usually the things that are interesting enough to share with friends are interesting enough to get a lot of engagement on social media.\nFourth thing. Any idea that you have - put it into a list app. I use the Microsoft To Do app, which is free. Below is a screenshot of different things I want to make videos on. I also have a folder on my laptop with content inspiration ideas - screenshots that make it easy for me to find the subject matter I want to later make content on.\nFifth thing. Make shooting and editing mind-numbingly easy. I use Descript. It uses AI to remove retakes and remove gaps between words. The video below was conceived, shot, edited, and posted all in 12 minutes. It got 4 million views across platforms.\n> @build_in_public This guy saw some dude wearing an NVIDIA hoodie at a party in San Francisco. He says, it's a better way to say I'm rich than wearing an AP. But it actually is crazy. A June poll of over 3,000 NVIDIA employees showed that 76% of them were millionaires, with 37% being worth over $20 million. #startups #buildinpublic #nvidia #ycombinator  original sound - Build in Public\nLast thing. Don't try to micromanage how you look or sound. 1. People like authenticity. 2. Micromanaging slows down production. 3. By being yourself you attract a loyal audience of people who appreciate you for you.\n## The reward for this?\nAs written above, the reward is extreme visibility . Instagram will give you tons of impressions and you will have more opportunity to share your products and services to people who want it.\n## Compact Keywords\nPeople have been making tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars per month with the method in my SEO Program, Compact Keywords. It's a step-by-step plan for getting your products and services in front of buyers/users when they need it most. It's actionable directions on exactly what to do with videos showing exactly how to do it and SEO templates meant to be copied and adapted for your business.\nThe SEO with this method is less work than normal SEO, way higher converting, and works so well that even ChatGPT recommends my products (I show this in the program). You can even use this to do SEO with Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, TikToks, and more. There's also a 30 day refund policy.\nHonestly, what has been happening has surpassed my expectations. You can learn more here .\n## Episode 566, \"Zuck turned down our pitch, changed his mind, and we made $745 mil\"\nIf you haven't listened to episode 566 of my podcast, it was a good one.\nI had on Kass and Mike Lazerow:\n- Sold their company for $745 million to Salesforce (they made the first social media management platform).\n- Google wanted it for $2 billion but was under antitrust heat from the U.S. government.\n- Gary Vaynerchuk started VaynerMedia from their conference room.\n- They pitched Mark Zuckerberg on allowing advertisers on Facebook back when Facebook was called \"thefacebook\" - Zuck didn't want to do it.\n- Founded Golf.com and sold it to Time Warner.\n- Advisors to Meta and invested in Meta pre-IPO.\n- Angel investors in Liquid Death, Tumblr, and Scopely.\n- Crazy stories about so many big players in tech and marketing.\n- Ranked No. 1 on Business Insider's Silicon Alley 100.\n- Married, business partners, and have 3 children together.\nYou can listen here: YouTube Apple Podcasts Spotify Audible"

I have crossposting for Stories, Posts, and Reels toggled on.\n- I upload manually though the Instagram mobile app. From the experience of me and my friends, content does way worse on Instagram if uploaded with a shared IP address, such as what you may get with a VPN or republishing tool. So I use neither for Instagram. Conversely, the only person I know to have well-performing Instagram posts with a republishing tool has a dedicated IP address with his tool. He's using SharingTools.services , which I have never tried, but he loves. I click  from the bottom menu, then \"REEL,\" then I choose my video. I choose a thumbnail within Instagram from the existing video. I paste the long TikTok description with my chosen keyword as the Instagram Reel description. Between TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels, there is a high likelihood of your video showing up on Google the next day for your keyword. I do not use hashtags. Hashtags on Instagram are bad for the health of a profile in the long run . Instagram is the only platform I don't use hashtags with. I specify the Reel shows on the Reels grid only. If it performs well, I manually add it to the main profile grid. This way my main profile grid shows only Reels that are above average. I toggle on \"Upload at highest quality.\" I recycle successful Instagram Reels around twice per year per Reel. If it did well before, it'll likely do well again .\n- From the experience of me and my friends, content does way worse on Instagram if uploaded with a shared IP address, such as what you may get with a VPN or republishing tool.

I'll also be using these posts on LinkedIn.\nI post at least once a day. Very simply put, the more you post in a day, the faster you grow, especially on Instagram.\nThe Instagram account below started March 1st . I'm writing this section on April 26 , 56 days later. The account has made 224 posts (Reels and images). 224/56=4.\nThe account is undergoing a rebrand, so the name may be different by the time you read this.\nMe over DM with the account: \"Did you do anything special? Other than doing multiple (4?) quality posts a day?\" The account: \"I did exactly this.\"\nThe account owner also showed me @ChatGPTricks (1.2M followers), which uses the same high-frequency posting strategy to grow.\nFinally, I love this quote from @viralvideo.club (541K followers), \"The fastest I ever grew was 135,000 followers in a single month. And guess what? I was posting three times per day. Now I'm posting between six and seven times per week. And in the last 30 days, I've grown about 85,000 followers. And I saw this impact immediately. As soon as I started posting less, I got less followers. So over the course of a month, I was gaining 50,000 less followers.\"\nAll the data shows high-frequency posting is the absolute best for Instagram, though I believe it's generally the best for most other social media platforms, too.\nAnd all of this is my exact social media posting strategy.\nUpdate: I tried high-frequency posting on Instagram. 11 videos posted in 2 days. I grew by 1,100+ followers a day, ~4x my normal rate. It works!"

    "text": "TL;DR : How I brute forced more images of my brand on Google Images and how you can do it too.\n#### Jump Ahead\nI can't believe this worked, and for the longest time I thought it wasn't working.\nBack in August, I made all these podcast episodes about how I was building a Photos page on my website.\nI was dissatisfied with how few images of me came up in Google Images when you searched Edward Sturm. I actually have a unique challenge: there is another Edward Sturm who makes viral videos . And yet another one with a growing social media presence.\nSo I theorized that by making a page optimized for \"Photos of Edward Sturm\" - I could get more pictures of me in there, and even better, pictures of my choosing.\nIt was a fun project - I enjoyed it. I made a jump-by-date option. I had a good time looking through past pictures and organizing them. I think the page looks cool. What I ended up with was this:\nhttps://edwardsturm.com/photos/\nAnd then it was done. I'll continue to add photos to it. 2024 needs another photo or two. And 2025 is going to be a great year.\n## BUT\nBut for the longest time after publishing that page, I thought it wasn't working.\nIt's been 5 months since I published that page. Every few months since, I'd check Google Images. I wouldn't see that many photos of me from it - maybe 3-5. And even worse, the photos at the top were a variety of Edward Sturms, not just me.\nSo because of how slow it was taking for images to show up - they were not showing up all at once, just one at a time - and due to the top portion being a variety of Edward Sturms, I thought it wasn't working .\nThen yesterday I thought of something I hadn't thought of before.\nExcel.\nI copied everything from Google Images for my name.\nI pasted just the text into Excel. It worked out way better than I expected:\nEach entry was separated by a blank row. So I used a simple formula to count all blank rows (including the bottom blank row).\n140 - meaning 140 images.\nThen I searched the Google Images page for mentions of \"Edward Sturm Photos | Edwardsturm.com\" - the Page Title for my photos page.\n22 images from my Photos page.\n\"Oh wow,\" I thought.\nI didn't think it had worked because the images were propagating one at a time (hopefully even more will continue to show) and because the top images were still a variety of people.\nBut when looking at the data - 1/6th of the images in Google Images for my name are coming from that photos page - that's crazy.\n## How you can do this too\nIt's very easy, just copy my formula.\nFirst, follow this guide: https://edwardsturm.com/articles/pareto-seo/#technical-seo - especially the part about submitting your site to Google Search Console. That article is 20% of SEO things that get 80% of results.\nNext, if you have a website with your name - make your URL, yourname.com/photos. If you don't have a website with your name, do yoursite.com/photos-firstname-lastname/\nPlace the link to this page in your footer.\nThen, literally copy my Page Title, Meta Description, and H1 heading but swap my name for yours. Feel free to do the same for the introductory text on the page. Swap my name for yours, too.\nUse dates, locations, or events to divide your images. I chose dates. Make each divider an H2 heading.\nNext, choose the photos that you want.\nThen, and this isn't key, but it's good for user experience, compress your photos. You can use a tool like TinyPNG . For me, I have the free TinyPNG plugin for WordPress and WordPress natively creates different sizes of each image. This way somebody on a smaller-width browser wouldn't have to download the full-sized image. Many popular site builders have features like this, so don't stress it too much.\nAfter this, put descriptive file names for your images. Here are some of mine:\nphotos_edward-sturm_with-steve-forbes-at-the-2024-forbes-iconoclast-summit.jpg\nphotos_edward-sturm_new-york-post-offices-studio-nyc-2024.png\nphotos_edward-sturm_teach-seo-microsoft-2017.webp\nVery simple format.\nphotos_firstname-lastname_short-description-date\nUpload your photos.\nSuper important - add descriptive alt text. Alt text tells search engines what the image is about. It's also what shows if the image fails to load for whatever reason.\nAll of my images' alt text contain my full name and year taken. Most contain the location of the photo as well.\nGenerally, it's also best to put your name near the beginning of the alt text.\n\"Edward Sturm instructing a large class on SEO at the Times Square Microsoft offices in 2017.\"\n\"Edward Sturm shaking hands with Forbes Media Chairman and Editor-in-Chief, Steve Forbes. Photo at the Forbes Iconoclast Summit in 2024.\"\nFinally, add captions that will show with each photo. You can just reuse your alt text, though I wrote shorter versions of the alt text to use as my captions.\n\"Edward Sturm teaching SEO at the Times Square Microsoft offices in 2017.\"\n\"Edward Sturm with Forbes Media Chairman and Editor-in-Chief, Steve Forbes. Photo taken in 2024.\"\nAnd that's it! Publish the page. Submit it to Google Search Console. Then wait.\nI didn't do any link building for this page . Due to my very clear targeting and placement of the page in my footer, the images propagated within Google Images on their own .\n## This doesn't just have to be for a person\nAnd this doesn't just have to be for you as a person. If you have a brand or product and you want more diverse images of it on Google Images, you can use this same format.\nSometimes these images also show up in normal Google Search, so it's really great.\nHope you'll give this a try.\n## Compact Keywords\nMy SEO Program, Compact Keywords, is getting rave reviews.\nIf you have a company that actually sells stuff - services, products - Compact Keywords is about how to use SEO to target keywords where searchers are looking to convert.\nThese keywords are often super overlooked and therefore very easy to rank for. The thing is:\n- Nobody thinks to go after them.\n- Nobody knows how to find them.\n- Everybody targets them wrong.\nCompact Keywords shares all of that with tons of videos, screen shares, templates, examples, concrete directions, and more.\nI always use the Compact Keywords method when doing serious SEO. A friend even just shared a story where the method made his client an extra $3,000,000 ARR with two days of work - that testimonial is at the top of the landing page.\nIf you don't have a website you can still use video or other platforms to target these keywords - there's a huge section on how to do just that.\nThere's a link building section, a fundamentals of SEO section (if you're just starting or only a few years in) - a customer told me Compact Keywords was the only resource that made him actually understand how to use Screaming Frog and how to do a site audit.\nAnd then lots of sections on offensive SEO and how to go after these high-converting keywords. Works for any niche. And there's a 30-day money back guarantee.\nYou can learn more at:\nhttps://compactkeywords.com/"

    "text": "Let's say you wanted to do networking.\nWould you rather:\n## Option A\n- Network where you get to look at accomplishments and descriptions and pick who you talk to.\n- Guarantee you're going to talk for an hour - enough time to create a connection.\n- Simultaneously build a personal brand.\n- Simultaneously do SEO.\n- Get paid for each networking call you have.\n## Option B\n- You meet a random person and talk to them for an unspecified amount of time and that's it.\n## What would you pick??\nOption B is normal networking.\nOption A might be one of the greatest networking hacks there is.\nPodcast hosting. Not normal podcast hosting - podcast hosting through podcast matching platforms .\nI previously talked about using these platforms to get easy guest appearances .\nBut it only occurred to me this morning that this is also a crazy networking/branding hack.\nI discovered these platforms in 2022 and used them to go on 30 podcasts in 3 months. Because I was paying for them, and because I was using them to get SEO backlinks, I said yes to every request I received. The result was a lot of podcast guest appearances.\nAnd the thing is, many people on these platforms have the same mindset. They'll say yes to everything, even if the show is new. They're paying the monthly subscription fee to get matched with hosts and go on shows.\nIf you're not already well-known or super-networked, it's hard to get on shows. Podcast matching platforms are a great place to start.\nBut I didn't consider it from the perspective of somebody doing networking.\n## How it works\nLet's say you're just starting in your field. If you have a microphone, great. If not, that's okay too.\nHere's what you do.\n## Level one\nUse PodMatch . I'm an affiliate of this platform and a huge fan of it. I used it to get 70% of my guest appearances in 2022 and it's the platform that pays hosts per episode. You won't make a lot but according to this breakdown you'll make enough to more than pay for the subscription fee.\nYou can also use MatchMaker.fm , which I got 20% of my guest appearances in 2022 from. However, MatchMaker does not pay hosts.\nCreate a host profile.\nLook through guest profiles and get matched with guests. Choose who you want to talk to.\nDo a minimum 1 hour Google Meet or Zoom. Treat it like you would a normal hangout / networking call. Have fun with it. Don't try to interview the other person, just try to create a connection. Screen record it.\nTake the audio and put it on Libsyn . Libsyn is what I use to host the audio versions of my daily podcast . It's inexpensive and also pushes your audio to Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Audible, etc.\nTake the video version and upload it to YouTube. Level one - do little to zero editing. Make the thumbnail just a screenshot from the video.\nYouTube videos rank ridiculously well on Google now:\nDo some keyword research to find a term that covers some of what you talked about on the call. Put that term at the beginning of the YouTube video title and at the beginning of the description for the video. Write a decently long description to cover what was talked about and make the video more searchable.\nUse the same title and description on Libsyn.\nShare the podcast episode on LinkedIn, Instagram, etc to show you're active in your niche. Tag the guest.\n## Level two\nStill use PodMatch , MatchMaker , Libsyn , and YouTube .\nStill treat the podcast like a networking call.\nStill do the keyword research and video SEO.\nBut put a little bit more effort into the production.\nRun the podcast through Descript Studio Sound (I use this for my daily podcast - it's one click and makes audio sound crispyyy).\nUse the Descript transcript editor to remove anything you don't want in the show.\nUse Descript's AI to automatically generate podcast timestamps and put these timestamps in the description.\nMake custom thumbnails for YouTube. Super easy. Have an AI image generation tool make an interesting background. Use remove.bg for free to get sharp cut outs of guests. Put the cut outs over the interesting background in a free tool like Figma . Apparently Canva is great for this too, though I don't use it.\nStill promote each episode on social media to demonstrate you are an active voice in your niche. You're becoming a thought leader while you are doing networking!\n## Level three\nDo everything in level two, but cut clips of the podcast to use on social media.\nI've posted 3-4,000 short form mobile videos since starting Nov. 1 2022. My audience is now nearing 300,000. This is exactly how I post my social videos each day . I update this article frequently. No fluff. It's exact posting directions for how to maximize reach.\n## Level four\nDo everything in level two. Level three, as well, if you want to edit yourself.\nHere's the thing, though. I get pitched by 3-5 video editors a day who want to edit my videos.\nA lot of them charge literally $10-15 dollars per video.\nHire one or several. Have them watch your shows and put out at least one edited clip a day.\nSome of my most popular videos are just edited clips from my own podcast. Like this one, below.\n> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nA post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nStart a clips channel or use these videos on your normal socials.\nHave your editor post for you using my posting guide .\nInstagram, TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, etc will push these clips out for you, generating traffic for your repurposed networking sessions.\nOnce you get the hang of it, scale with more clips each day.\n## That's it!\nWhile I don't meet new people as much as I used to, I still love having a vibrant network. It's gotten me cofounders, meetings with top investors and builders, secretive information, invites to exclusive clubs and parties, useful advice I wouldn't have gotten anywhere else, and lifelong friends who bring me joy each day.\nHad I realized I could do networking while easily building a brand, I would have done it years ago.\nI was already doing virtual networking with Lunchclub , but I didn't realize I could do it with podcasts and get all the extra benefits.\nSuper crazy. Everybody thinks of repurposing content. Nobody thinks of repurposing networking."

    "text": "This is a trick that still works.\nAt the end of 2016 I wanted to rank high on Google for \"SEO trends 2017.\"\nMy SEO skills were far from what they are now, I had a new site, and I didn't have much time.\nIt was around September. I put together my article. I published it, submitted it to Google Search Console, and waited.\nNothing happened.\nI didn't rank \n## Again\nIn 2017 I wanted to rank high on Google for \"SEO trends 2018.\"\nMy SEO skills had improved a bit, but my site was still relatively new.\nThere was, however, an important new asset I had.\nA head start.\nIt was Spring. The year before I started in Autumn. 2017, I'm arriving to the party early.\nI wrote my article.\nNot going to lie, it was stupid. Crypto had started blowing up so I wrote that blockchain was going to be a major trend in SEO in 2018, lmao. It made my content more relevant. Of course I also added voice search, schema, information architecture, all that fun stuff.\nSide note: information architecture actually is HUGELY important, and something I think is very fun.\n## I didn't need it\nWhile important for competitive keywords like this, I didn't want to do a thorough link building campaign - I preferred to put that energy and resources elsewhere.\nTurns out I didn't need it. I didn't need the link building campaign.\nIn Spring of 2017 I was the only person writing about SEO trends coming in 2018.\nThis made it so that I was near immediately at the top of Google not long after publishing.\nAnd every month or so I'd update the article - add something new, or clarify something, etc. And then I'd alter the date published to reflect the updated content.\nWhat happened is when the hot season came around, I was first to show, and I naturally acquired backlinks.\nI was the only site that had written about SEO trends in 2018 so other blogs linked to my article.\nBy the time the big players - Neil Patel, Backlinko, Ahrefs, HubSpot, Moz, etc. - wrote their SEO trends in 2018 articles, I was already ranking well.\nAnd while I didn't end up beating all these players that year, I did beat some of them.\nMy goal was to rank well, and I did it with an article I wrote in an afternoon and briefly updated every month to stay current.\nI didn't even manually go out and build links.\n## Why is this cool?\n- Every niche has keywords like this. Fintech trends in 2025. Agriculture trends 2025. Restaurant trends 2025. Every niche.\n- The main people searching keywords like this will be in your niche. By showing up for these keywords, it's an easy way to make your brand a thought leader. In my case the people searching \"SEO trends 2018\" were people at performance marketing agencies, even top ones.\n- For many of us, when we have ambitious dreams, what we instead see is a huge mountain. The thing is, if you try to climb that mountain all at once, it's 100% going to be difficult or impossible. But if you slow play it and get a head start, if you're willing to wait and take gradual steps (in my case making small updates each month), that ambitious goal is achievable. Very achievable, in fact. But when you're head up again the mountain, with little time to spare (me in 2016), it's hard.\nOne of the craziest or most nonsensical shortcuts you can take to your goal is to take the long cut. Get the head start. Give yourself time. And that intimidating mountain, while still a mountain, becomes a lot more achievable."

No way. Edward, you're lying.\"\nAnd I'm saying, \"Nah.\"\nSo that you can use this for your brand, I want to explain how this came about.\nJun 6, 2024. My first video explaining Link Echoes in SEO. It consists of a hook, defining Link Echoes, how this was discovered, tons of extra context, and the consequences of Link Echoes. - 55 seconds\nJun 20, 2024. I notice the first video ranked and wanted to see if I could do it again. My video is a bit tighter (not on purpose). It consists of the hook, defining Link Echoes, some extra context, and consequences. - 43 seconds.\nSep 19, 2024. A marketing agency takes my first Link Echoes videos, cuts my script to an even tighter version, and ranks above all my videos. Their video consists of defining Link Echoes, how this was discovered, consequences, and relating it to their client work (smart!). - 36 seconds.\nDec 17, 2024. On my daily podcast , I notice the agency above beating me for the keyword with their way-shortened version of my first script. I briefly explain what Link Echoes are on the podcast. Then I say, \"I bet I can rank #1 again for the keyword by editing this explanation into an even shorter video.\" Three point line, I call my shot.\nDec 18, 2024. I edit the Link Echoes explanation from my podcast. The edited video consists only of a hook, the definition, and the consequences. - 18 seconds - ranks #1 for the keyword 8 hours after being published. Swish.\n## Perspective\nI want to put this into perspective for a moment.\nThere are dozens of articles written about Link Echoes in SEO. Dozens. Some took hours to make. Some are long and took days. All these articles likely took months to rank on Google.\nI made my video in 10 minutes. 8 hours after publishing it, it ranked #1 for the keyword. None of my three videos for this took more than an hour to make. All of them ranked the next day and they all automatically rank above the articles.\nInsane marketing and SEO hack.\n## Why this works\nHere's why this works so you can do it yourself.\n- The keyword is placed at the beginning of the title field and the beginning of the description field. The rest of the description is populated with an edited transcript of the video. Here's exactly how I post my daily YouTube Shorts, TikToks, and Instagram Reels . This emphasizes that the video is hyper-relevant to the keyword.\n- The video is shorter (people want answers/solutions) fast! You'd much prefer to get your answer from an 18 second video, than reading a long article.\n- The video is more recent.\n## Remaining to test\nThe thing remaining for me to test is what is more important, short duration or recency?\nAll the videos rank in ascending order of video length and recency.\nMy guess is it's a combination of the two, and maybe recency is a bit more important.\n## My recommendation\nTry YouTube Shorts to rank on Google for your keywords. It doesn't work for every keyword, but it works for enough to make the time investment worthwhile.\nPut your keyword at the beginning of the title field and description field. Use a long description. Use three hashtags.\nIf targeting a top-of-funnel keyword (Link Echoes in SEO is an example of this) relate it to your brand similar to how the agency did. \"Our SEO clients noticed Link Echoes...\"\nDon't be afraid to make multiple videos targeting the same keyword. In the same time it takes to write a single page/post about your keyword, you could make 5-10 videos on it - each video hitting the keyword from a different angle.\nThere hasn't been a crazy SEO opportunity like this in a long time. And because most SEOs just make written content, very few digital marketers even know about this.\nI hope you'll give it a try."

    "text": "One of the best-kept secrets of SEO is that you don't need perfect high authority backlinks, perfect anchor text, or perfect on-page optimization to rank for keywords.\nIn fact, Google prefers it messy and inconsistent.\nSo here are 3 short stories of where deoptimizing led to high rankings within Google.\nSearch engine deoptimization \n## Low Domain Authority sites increasing Google rankings\nAn SEO had a US-nationally-recognized appliance company as a client.\nThe client wanted to be in the top three results for something like \"toaster ovens.\" Very competitive.\nThey had tons of backlinks from high Domain Authority sites.\nIf you're not familiar with Domain Authority, it's an SEO metric that determines how easily a website can rank on search engines for competitive keywords (what you put into Google).\nDomain Authority increases by having backlinks (a site linking to your site) and generally, backlinks from high Domain Authority sites are more valuable than from low ones... or at least this is what people think!\nThe client, being nationally recognized, already had high Domain Authority backlinks. Plenty of them.\nIts competitors did too.\nBut here's the thing - all the companies were only going after these high Domain Authority backlinks.\nSites like the New York Times, or Forbes, or Popular Mechanics.\nThe SEO said, \"You already have plenty of high Domain Authority backlinks. I'm going to give you a more natural backlink profile.\"\nThe SEO spent four months going after less competitive, low Domain Authority sites - mom & pop personal niche blogs, hobbyist blogs, etc.\nThe differentiation worked and got the client to where they wanted to be.\nWhy?\n## Principle\nLife, business, whatever, despite our best efforts, is rarely clean and organized.\nA growing or popular brand doing zero SEO is very unlikely to get backlinks from only high or low Domain Authority sites. It will be a mix.\nThis is called a \"natural backlink profile;\" it looks natural .\nAnd Google, just like everybody else, likes natural.\nYou don't want to buy synthetic at the supermarket, you want to buy natural .\nBack to marketing, you don't want to buy from an influencer who's only paid to shill a product to you. You want that influencer to actually be sharing it because they believe in it.\nYou want the real thing.\nSo by making the backlink targeting a bit messy, it led to the client having a natural backlink profile.\nAnd that's what Google likes.\n## Removing keywords from a page to rank for removed keywords\nTypically, you want to have your target keyword in the:\n- Page title\n- Meta description\n- URL\n- Top heading (H1)\n- First sentence\nThis tells searchers arriving on the page that the page is for them. If you're searching, \"NYC piano repair services\" and you come across a page that has \"NYC piano repair services\" in its page title, meta description, URL, top heading, and first sentence (all the visible areas to the searcher) you will know this page is for you.\nBut if you use the keyword, especially if it is a longer keyword, too much, you will overoptimize.\nYou will make something that doesn't read or look natural .\nAnd that's just what I did.\nIt was a few years ago. I was looking at why some pages of mine were not ranking whereas others were.\nI noticed the pages that were not ranking had 2-4 too many uses of the keyword. I had been using it in the aforementioned places, but also in the alt text, or too many times in the body text.\nSo what did I do?\nI removed a few occurrences from the body text and/or from the alt text. Sometimes I even replaced the keyword in meta description or first sentence with a slight variation. Example: \"piano repair services in NYC.\"\nMost of the time, my previously overoptimized pages began ranking after this.\n## Targeting generic anchor text to rank better\nAnchor text is the text that shows over a link.\nFor the link: my SEO articles , the anchor text is \"my SEO articles.\"\nTypically, anchor text that is your page's targeted keyword is most valuable. Why? This says to readers who see the link that this link is exactly about that keyword.\nLet's say your keyword is \"instant approval credit card.\" You make a page targeting that. Now you want to have tons of backlinks with the anchor text, \"instant approval credit card\" ...or at least this is what people think!\nThe same SEO from the first story had a medium-sized credit card company as a client. The major competitors were doing the same backlink strategy: they were mostly going after exact-match anchor text (having the anchor text be your exact target keyword).\nThe SEO differentiated the client by going after mostly generic anchor text. Anchor text like here, click here, alternatives, this brand, this, website, info, etc.\nThe target keyword, instead of being the anchor text, was placed next to the generic anchor text.\nNatural .\nThe SEO ran this link building campaign for, as with the previous client, four months.\nThe keyword was purchase intent, high volume, and in the 90th percentile of difficulty.\nThe natural link building campaign worked .\nThe client got to where they wanted to be.\n## Deoptimize\nWhen you target searchers and not search engines, you realize how important deoptimization is.\nOver-optimization is spammy.\nSearchers don't want the spam. They want grass-fed, free range, non-GMO, no artificial preservatives, all that stuff.\nWhether it's on-page optimization, on-site, or link building, it's typically best to deoptimize, have variety, and appear natural ."

I hadn't made a video for the day, so I had to make one (currently at 761 days in a row). I was at a cafe with other people around who could hear me. I was a bit self conscious. I was caffeinated.\nI have a rule for promoting products. I only promote products which I've either used a lot and loved, and/or just really believe in.\nI often make videos recommending products without being paid just because I want to give value.\nHowever, if a product that I'm going to recommend has an affiliate program, of course I'm going to use my affiliate link. If not, I'd still recommend the product.\nAnyway - I used PodMatch to go on 30 podcasts in 3 months back before I was making daily videos, when I was relatively unknown.\nI've made several videos about this tool because it brought me so much value, but the video above is my most popular one.\nAnd in order to get people to go to my longgg affiliate link ( https://podmatch.com/?ref=1662204885108408577916226610560 ) I bought aipodcastmatcher.com for $10 and I redirect this short memorable URL (easy to say in videos) to that long link.\nEvery few hours I get an email like this:\nPodMatch charges monthly and annually. I get a 20% recurring commission for anybody who signs up through my link.\nAnd as I've shared in previous articles, I can reuse a well-performing video every ~6 months after people have forgotten it. 75% of the time the videos will go viral again!\n## Now here's what's cool\nI'm the biggest affiliate for another tool, repurpose.io , and it's all from this one video:\n> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nA post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nI talk about how well that video performed here .\nBut both videos have great hooks.\nAnd the hooks are actually the same:\n- Tight shot of my face.\n- Captions in the middle.\n- Whispering.\n- Ambient cafe sounds and no music.\nThe tight selfie shot and whispering in public makes it seem like you're about to get secret information. People are a lot more likely to pay attention!\nThe content past the hook is also the same:\n- Extended build up before sharing the product.\n- Explaining personal experience.\n- Casual speaking.\n- Sharing my laptop showing my actual set up with the product (proof that I use it).\n- Direct URLs shared.\n## A pattern is emerging\nI'm going to test more, but it seems like a pattern is emerging for easy promotion of products.\nIf this is the case you'll see me using this format a ton to share my SEO Program when I do the full release in a few weeks.\nImportant to note is I'm sure the format could get played out if I use it too much.\nBut if every few of my videos has a video with this format in it, I think it will be good.\nAnd what's especially cool is it's easy to try a million times.\nSuper easy and fast to shoot.\nSuper easy and fast to edit.\nMy editing tool, Descript (I'm not an affiliate of this one but I love it nonetheless), automatically removes all gaps between words, removes retakes, and adds captions.\nSo all I need to do is record, have Descript's AI make my rough cut, and then trim if there's anything left I want removed.\n## So I love this\nThis is the advantage I get from making at least one video a day. Every now and then I stumble onto something that can be above-average powerful.\nThis one in particular is fast, easy, and a tangible format to make people pay attention to your products.\nI can't wait to try it more and I hope you'll give it a try as well."

I once tried putting acoustic panels in here, but all the panels fell off the walls, and I didn't care enough to try again.

It's an affiliate video for a content repurposing tool I've been using daily since starting videos Nov 1 2022. I recorded my script in a crowded hotel lobby coworking space. There were strangers to my left, right, and behind me. There was music playing in the lobby. I needed a video for the day. \"No time like the present,\" I said. I read my script and did my best to make it look authentic. The link above is a repost. The video is so continuously high-performing that I'm able to repost it every couple of months without it getting stale. The best part - the product it's for is SaaS, with recurring customer charges, and a recurring affiliate program. I get 25% recurring commission for every sale I refer.

I made it in March, 2023. I filmed it on the selfie camera of an iPhone 8 - it looks like it was shot on a potato.

The day I made this, I made a total of 9 videos - in that single day. This video was #6 or #7. By making so many videos, I had stopped caring about perfection. I was in a very loud cafe when I made this. I had to talk loudly over the ambient sound. I'm also shooting with potato quality on that iPhone 8.

    "text": "I outranked the New York Times in Google Search within 5 minutes of publishing an article that I outsourced for free.\nThe year was 2020. It was lockdowns. I had expected to take a flight home to NYC. The flight was canceled. I was sitting out lockdowns in the center of Kyiv, Ukraine. It was a crazy time. Everyone was on their computers. I was going all in on SEO.\nWe created a simple SaaS tool a few months earlier. I launched it on Product Hunt . Educators liked it. It got covered in a few edtech blogs.\nI used these blog backlinks to jumpstart a bottom-of-funnel SEO initiative. Target keywords where the searchers know what they want, they just don't know the brand that will give it to them. This is what I was doing.\nThe SEO started working. We had more users. Then...\nWe got to an under 1,000,000 score on Similarweb.\nSimilarweb ranks websites by the amount of traffic they receive. It's highly inaccurate. Lots of businesses love it.\nOne of these businesses was Help a Reporter Out. You may remember Help a Reporter Out from my article last week . They just shut down, but their founder started a new service that works the same, called Source of Sources.\nAnyway, back in 2020, Help a Reporter Out was far from shutting down. It was very sought after.\nSimple premise: Journalists who need expert quotes for their articles submit a question. Experts answer. Journalists pick their favorite answer. They get their quote and the expert gets press, clout, and backlinks.\nBut how do they measure who is an authoritative journalist and who is not?\nThey use Similarweb.\nIn order to post as a journalist on Help a Reporter Out, your website needs to have a score of under 1,000,000.\nSo when my SaaS tool got that, I was hyped.\nI could get well-known experts to:\n- Write for us and then flex on LinkedIn that we included them in our blog - this actually happened.\n- Write entire articles for us - asking for entire articles was against the rules of Help a Reporter Out but I was determined to make it happen.\n## Here's how I did it\nFirst, nobody was going to take my brand seriously if it was me, the founder, posting the question as a journalist. I needed to make our new SaaS look like a bigger company.\nI created a fake journalist with a fake photo. I gave her a Twitter where she posted about her favorite foods and other nonsense a few times a month. If you Googled her, she looked real enough. In her email signature it said, \"Editor.\"\nShe posted Help a Reporter Out questions in edtech - we had decided to go in on that niche after the edtech blogs included us. She asked a question and said more words, detail, and paragraphs were preferable. Not against the guidelines of Help a Reporter Out. Not yet.\nHere's where she changed up the game.\nOnce she got a decent response, she'd follow up. \"This is excellent! I could actually see this being a full article on our main blog. Would it be possible to add 200 - 500 more words to this? Thank you so much!!!!\"\nThis is the actual follow up message she sent. It was me writing that as our fake editor.\nThat's all it took.\nThis simple response from our fake editor was always enough to get an entire article from an expert.\n## SEO\nThe thing is, many experts responding are just normal experts who don't know the first thing about SEO.\nA lot of them are using Help a Reporter Out for clout and distribution, not backlinks. They think that by being included in our SaaS blog it will get their business more customers and it will be a good flex on LinkedIn. They don't even know about Similarweb and its rankings and all of this.\nThen there was me.\nSEO is what I do. It is my life.\nI used Help a Reporter Out for backlinks, to tell Google's algorithms what my businesses are about, and of course - to flex on LinkedIn.\nBut when I realized I could use it to outsource content - that was a game changer.\nSo while doing keyword research I came across a keyword I liked. \"Will distance learning be permanent?\" The reason I liked it was it was high volume because of lockdowns, and no other websites were targeting it properly.\nThe ranking websites for it did not have it in their:\n- Page title\n- Meta description\n- URL\n- H1\n- First sentence\nThose are the places you want your keyword to appear. Nobody was targeting it like this. The New York Times was ranking #1 for this keyword with a similar article, but it wasn't targeting this exactly.\nOne of my journalist queries with the fake journalist was basically, \"We're writing an article about if distance learning will be permanent. Please share your thoughts and credibility in education. Longer answers will be rewarded, so feel free to write as much as you can on this!\"\nAfter the bulk of the article was written by the expert, all I had to do was proofread, add images, and put the keyword in the correct places above.\nAnd that's exactly what I did.\n## Now it's never this fast\nRanking on Google is never usually this fast.\nI think in this case it was due to an increasing amount of weekly users from my bottom-of-funnel SEO pages, overall relevance of our site to the keyword, and my precise targeting.\nEither way, I was dumbstruck.\nThis had never happened before. And this has never happened since. I thought it was a glitch.\nI did the usual - published my new page, added the keyword to my keyword tracking tool, then submitted the page to Google Search Console so that Google would know it exists.\n5 minutes later the page was ranking #1. The New York Times was now ranking... #2... right below our page published 5 minutes ago.\nI called up my cofounder at home in NYC. I asked him to check too. He saw the same thing.\nI will say - when a site is doing well - it is not unusual to rank fast for a keyword. But 5 minutes is incredible and we had only just surpassed an under 1 million score on Similarweb.\nWe don't rank #1 for this keyword anymore, but this was the first few years ranking for it:\nAfter starting at position #1, Google dropped us down within days to position #5. Google is a volatile beast and this was for several reasons:\n- Google hates when it thinks you understand it. Understanding exactly how it works makes it more likely you will game it and rank bad content. This harms searchers and as a result harms Google. The random volatility makes you focus more on the fundamentals (\"write good content\").\n- Google is constantly testing. Testing click-through rate. Testing retention. Testing engagement.\nRegardless, as you can see from the image, we quickly got back up to #1 and stayed there for years.\n## The craziest thing\nA few months after publishing this article, we got into an edtech accelerator.\nI honestly don't even know how to preface this next part, it is so wild.\nThe amount of people in our cohort was small. Under 20, if I recall.\nOne of them was...\nYou guessed it.\nThe person who guest wrote this article!\nThe accelerator was remote and I scheduled a video chat with her. She was accomplished in her own right and I wanted to meet her.\nI told her everything. Similarweb. The fake journalist. The keyword targeting. And her article which was then still ranking #1 for the keyword.\nShe wasn't even angry.\nThe keyword at the time had tons of educators and parents searching it.\nAnd the qualified traffic was great for us both."

NY Times, Fox News, Washington Post, WSJ, Reuters, AP, The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, and many, many more.\nI used this to get backlinks from the highest domain authority news sites possible.\nSidenote: a backlink is when one site links to another site. If the linking site has many high authority backlinks of its own, then it too becomes authoritative. This authority helps to rank for keywords within Google (and even prioritizes which websites are used in some AI chatbots).\n## SoS\nSoS - Source of Sources - I'm obsessed with this tool.\nPeter Shankman (above) founded Help a Reporter Out, sold it in 2010, and left the company in 2012.\nYears later he founded Source of Sources, a competitor to Help a Reporter Out, and it is LEGIT.\nBefore I share why it's so legit, this is why Help a Reporter Out had become unusable:\n- Tons of AI generated responses to journalists.\n- Tons of people sending journalists irrelevant pitches.\n- General nonsense responses to journalists that wasted their time.\n- Help a Reporter Out's expert scoring system was never used.\nAnd then comes along SoS - Source of Sources:\n- If you pitch a journalist something irrelevant even once , you're booted from the platform.\n- If you respond to a journalist with AI written text, you're booted from the platform.\n- If you waste a journalist's time with nonsense... you're booted from the platform.\n- No forgiveness for offenders. Bans for life.\n## And here's why I'm now obsessed with Source of Sources\nLess spam means a way higher likelihood of journalists actually seeing your response.\nHere is where these journalists are from:\nSource of Sources is a 2x/day email that goes out sharing journalists who need expert sources for their content. As the expert, you read through a list of queries, and respond to whoever you want. You literally are given the journalists' personal emails.\nThis is what it looks like:\nAnd the kicker: it's entirely free! 100% free.\nRespond to journalists. Get top backlinks. Appear in authoritative publications. Put those logos on your website and flex on LinkedIn that you were quoted in so-and-so top news outlets.\nSo pour one out for Help a Reporter Out.

If I was doing this now, I'd use ChatGPT or Gemini to help me think of tasks and tools to add.\nLinkedIn is also a recommendation engine, and this added detail helps LinkedIn know where to recommend you.\nHere's a screenshot from my LinkedIn in 2016 when I was trying to get SEO recruiters to reach out (what you see in this screenshot got me hired at one of the best SEO agencies in the world doing SEO for blue chip companies):\nThe rule of thumb is:\n- Put your niche and a few synonyms for it in your Headline.\n- Put a super thorough About section. Bullet out accomplishments. Put tons of tasks you might perform in your position ( anything you can think of that would be done on the job). Put in all the tools you might have to use.

Again, bullet things out so it's easy to read.\n## Use action words\nThis one's simple.\nUse action words.\nExamples:\n\"Achieved, Managed, Delivered, Improved, Optimized, Enhanced, Generated, Spearheaded, Increased, Transformed.\"\nChatGPT and Gemini are excellent at helping to think of these, by the way.\n## Show results\nThis is the last one.\nPre-2016 I actually didn't have a LinkedIn.\nIt was my close friend Ashley Zernich who became a recruiter and showed me what other recruiters were looking for on LinkedIn.\nShe taught me to add a ton of detail to my LinkedIn, to add action words, and to add results.\nI still remember like it was yesterday, her stressing, \"People want to see results.\"\nSo wherever I could, I'd add in results, no matter how minimal.\nHere's an example from my LinkedIn , and then from David's.\n## Connections\nOnce your profile is updated, get as many connections as you can with people you know in real life. Think of everybody you've ever met, especially in a work context, and add them.\nConnections help the algorithm prioritize relevant people.\nIf you're not in a major area like NYC, or San Francisco, etc, it's okay. Look for people in your industry who are there. Connect with them and give them a unique compliment or reason you want to connect. It could even be transparent, \"I'm looking to connect with more people in my industry in major American cities.\" Adding context will make people more likely to accept the connection.\n## Use Featured section & Experience section examples\nUtilized the \"Featured\" section right under the About section. Add links and make sure those links have a thumbnail, title, and description.\nThen do the same for your roles and experience. Notice in the second image below, under \"Production Assistant,\" I have media with corresponding titles and descriptions.\n## Honorable mentions\nHere are some bonus things to do.\n- Get written recommendations from anybody you can. When I did my LinkedIn in 2016 I valued recommendations so highly I even asked my website developer ( who I was paying and not the other way around ) to give me a recommendation. In fact if you go to my LinkedIn , scroll to recommendations at the bottom, and go back in time you can see all the recommendations I got in 2016. Recommendations are great because they're hard to fake. People can click on profiles and see that they're real active people, which makes you look legitimate.\n- Recommendations are great because they're hard to fake. People can click on profiles and see that they're real active people, which makes you look legitimate.\n- Give recommendations. This has a few benefits: Giving recommendations makes it easier to get them. The activity on your LinkedIn page helps LinkedIn know who to show your profile to. Giving recommendations makes people like you more. Please feel free to give me a recommendation, and I will like you more \n- Giving recommendations makes it easier to get them.\n- The activity on your LinkedIn page helps LinkedIn know who to show your profile to.\n- Giving recommendations makes people like you more. Please feel free to give me a recommendation, and I will like you more \n- Please feel free to give me a recommendation, and I will like you more \n- When your profile is fully updated with all the extra details, let your network know it's updated.\n## Open to Work\nThis one's a personal preference, but don't don't put \"Open to Work\" on your profile picture.\nIt makes people look desperate, and that's not attractive to recruiters, employers, or anybody else.\nIn 2016 when I got the job and was employed it made recruiters and hiring managers reach out to me EVEN MORE.\nPeople won't reach out because your profile says Open to Work; they'll reach out because you look competent and in demand, and your profile was recommended by LinkedIn because it was so highly optimized.\n## What to prioritize\nThe Pareto Principle of this all, in terms of what to prioritize, is:\n- Add lots of keywords around tasks you might perform and tools you might use. Add as much as you can.\n- Get as many recommendations as you can.\n- Get as many connections as you can.\n- Add as many examples as possible.\nThese 20% of LinkedIn optimizations will get you 80% of the results.\n## The podcast\nIf you want to hear me go in-depth on LinkedIn, here's my podcast that David listened to get him hired.\nIn it, I also provide details on how I added results to my LinkedIn (what I did when I wanted more results) and what I did once the recruiters started reaching out."

    "text": "I recently had my most viral YouTube Short by far .\nWhile two weeks ago I wrote my philosophy on how I created it (use validated topics and execution styles), at the time I didn't expect it to go as viral as it did.\nIt just kept on growing on YouTube Shorts.\nAnd performed well on other platforms too.\nSo in this article, I did something I never do.\nI made an infographic!\nFull resolution image here .\nAnd here's the video, below.\n> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nA post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nHere are three things that stick out to me:\n- Retention is sooooo important . If you watch the video, you'll notice it's 4 marketing stunts all in one 59 second video. This keeps it moving fast. When you combine this with the general audience subject matter and interesting activities, retention is kept high.\n- People liked the video right away on TikTok . Something I've noticed is TikTok is one of the best testing grounds for hooks . My hook in this video was negative (negative hooks perform better than positive ones), even though I kept the rest of the video positive. I also had a good music-to-visual match right at the beginning. As a result of all this, you see most viewers liked the video right away on TikTok + the good hook helped with retention, above. In fact this is a quote from MrBeast's internal company handbook : \"Say the negatives. Don't just tell people on your team or me why something is good. It's infinitely more valuable to tell us why it's not good. I FOUND THE CASTLE WE NEED FOR THE VIDEO! But it's booked all year, over-budget, and someone died in it last week.\" The same principle applies to engagement.\n- In fact this is a quote from MrBeast's internal company handbook : \"Say the negatives. Don't just tell people on your team or me why something is good. It's infinitely more valuable to tell us why it's not good. I FOUND THE CASTLE WE NEED FOR THE VIDEO! But it's booked all year, over-budget, and someone died in it last week.\" The same principle applies to engagement.\n- TikTok top words in comments shows a range of topics. Everybody knows the eight brands in this video + the stunts are dramatic. As a result, there's something for everybody to remark on. Rather than telling people to comment/like, I make it easy for them by giving things that are relevant and polarizing. You see this in the engagement stats too - there's correlations between views, and likes + comments.\nI think there's a ton more lessons in these stats, but those are the biggest ones that stuck out to me.\nOptimize for relevance, get people to like right away, and give something polarizing to engage with."

It's 25 exact hooks to use for short-form video.\nThe original was 456 words, so it really did not take me long to write.\nTo my surprise, checking Google Search Console this morning, I saw this article is ranking #4 on Google for \"hooks for YouTube Shorts.\"\n\"Hooks for YouTube Shorts\" isn't actually used on the page, but given the meta tags and subject matter, Google ranked this lazy article of mine anyway.\n## Here's the trick\nThis is one of my favorite tricks for quickly getting some extra traffic from search.\nIf you see you're ranking well for a keyword, and it's either not used on the page - or if it is used but doesn't have detail around it - use it and add detail.\nThat's it.\nI added a section with the keyword as the heading. Then a few words of text under the heading.\nI also added an image.\nI saw that one of the pages ranking above me for the keyword gives general advice on hooks, whereas my page gives exact hooks. So this new text I wrote is more just advice on ideating new hooks.\nAll in all everything took me five minutes to put together.\n## But I didn't stop there\nI then had the thought, \"I could probably rank well for equivalent keywords for TikTok and Instagram Reels.\"\nSo I wrote 178 more words.\nAgain, did not take much time on this.\nFinally, I said, \"Well if this page is going to get all this extra traffic from search, I should try a bit harder to get people into my ecosystem.\"\nSo I added this - 48 words:\nYou can see the updated page here .\n## Then I...\nThen I updated the article publishing date to today, submitted the changes to Google Search Console - this prompts Google to crawl the updated page - and now we wait.\nThis is a trick I've used countless times to quickly get extra traffic from Google. You may already do this. But if ya haven't tried, or haven't done it in a while, I hope you'll give it a shot.\nSee what you're already ranking well for... and add it to your page."

    "text": "Here's 25 thumb-stopping hooks for TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and any other platform that uses scrolling mobile video.\nWhat's a hook?\nA hook is what comes at the beginning of a piece of content to suck people in. A good hook keeps somebody watching, reading, listening, and engaging with the piece of content. In our age of limited attention, hooks are necessary with every channel and every piece of media.\nDid you know?\nHooks can also be distributed throughout content to keep people engaged. However, a hook at the beginning is always necessary.\nHere's 25 hooks you can use right now .\n- Your X isn't (ugly, lame, etc.), you just need X .\n- Hot (girls, photographers, etc..) don't gatekeep.\n- X I've done but it casually gets (worse, more expensive, etc.).\n- I don't know how this isn't trending right now, but X .\n- If you want to be (cooler, skinnier, funnier, etc.) you have to X .\n- POV: you X .\n- X things I wish I would have known sooner, but I didn't, so I am sharing them with you.\n- Reasons why you should X .\n- I would crazy situation (give my left kidney, do illegal stuff) for X .\n- Here is the exact X you need to know as an X .\n- Let's talk about the # things that will save you from X .\n- If crazy situation (I was on death row, my house was burning down) I would X .\n- Have you ever felt like X ?\n- If you like X , you will love X .\n- If you have ever struggled with X , do X .\n- I don't know about you, but I hate X .\n- The truth about X .\n- Put a finger down if X .\n- This is your sign to X .\n- Even though everyone on your fyp is telling you something different, here's the truth.\n- Is there anything worse than X ?\n- I need your help to X .\n- I can't believe I just (learned/noticed) this.\n- If you're under ( # of age ) and you're not X , listen up!\n- Stop doing X .\n## Hooks for YouTube Shorts\nThis YouTube Short of mine just hit 6 million views.\nIt has a great hook, \"The marketing pettiness is so incredible.\" - And it uses topics that are more general audience.\nTo keep people watching on YouTube Shorts, focus on hooks that are negative (the rest of the video can still be positive) and that have some general audience interest.\nYouTube Shorts, especially, likes general audience hooks.\n## Hooks for TikTok\nDid you know TikTok's algorithms recommend music based on your video?\nTikTok audiences especially love it when a video's sound matches its subject matter, rhythm, and style.\nThe best example of this is at the start of the video - the hook.\nWith a great sound that matches a nice visual, your video has a much better chance of performing well.\nIf you're doing a speaking video with no sound, negative hooks, as mentioned above, also do well. \" This is the dark reality of... \" Again, the rest of the video can still be positive.\n## Hooks for Instagram Reels\nLike TikTok, Instagram Reels' hooks should have beautiful visuals and unique matching music .\nAside from this, very interesting subject matter always does well on Instagram Reels.\nStart your Reel with lines about how nobody knows what you're about to tell them.\nPeople will pay attention when they believe they're about to get obscure and useful information.\n\"Nobody knows...\" \"Nobody realizes...\" This overlooked secret...\"\n## How I post\nI've posted over 1,800 TikToks, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels for over 700 days in a row (I started November 1st, 2022).\nHere's exactly how I post in under 5 minutes to read. The settings I use to maximize reach on every platform, constantly updated.\n## More hooks\nHere's 7 more viral hooks .\nAnd here are hooks I use constantly .\nReally, you can't go wrong with that last link. Those hooks are key.\n## The truth about hooks\nThey work!\nThey work well.\nMy content didn't start going viral consistently until I started putting thought into hooks. Here's the 4 biggest iterations I made with my content which got me the most results (hooks are #1).\n## Negative hooks do better than positive hooks\nFinally, to reiterate, negative hooks usually perform better than positive hooks.\nHere's a video on the power of negative hooks."

I told the story in a different podcast and turned this into a vertical video. This video, uploaded last night, is going viral and is up to 150,000 views 16 hours after posting.\nAnd crazy enough, all 3 mobile videos contain the exact same information , just told in different ways.\nUnless the subject matter is based on current events, if people like it once, they'll like it again.\nI made a bio video about Caleb Simpson last year. He's the guy who goes around asking people how much their apartments cost and if he can get a tour.\nThat video went viral.\nA couple days ago I rerecorded the script, unchanged, put in different images, and the video went viral again .\nIf people like it once, they'll like it again.\nI made a video about Burger King's moldy Whopper stunt. This was done to show they don't use artificial preservatives unlike competitors. My video has gotten over 10 million views across platforms.\nI made a video about the time Samsung bought out and renamed the train station in front of the new Apple Store Malaysia. Samsung renamed the station \" The Samsung Galaxy Station \" and plastered ads all over it. This video has gotten 9 million views across platforms.\nWendy's did a stunt where they sold ice cream in front of McDonald's as McDonald's is known to have broken ice cream machines. This stunt went viral.\nBMW and Audi competed for who could buy the biggest billboard. BMW won by ultimately getting a blimp and attaching it to Audi's large billboard. This stunt went viral.\nI think you know what's coming next.\nI made a video about all four of these ! I opened with the hook, \"The marketing pettiness is incredible\" because I saw \"marketing pettiness\" used in a top comment on my Samsung vs. Apple video. The first part of the video is the Wendy's stunt. The next is BMW vs. Audi. Then is Burger King. Then is Samsung vs. Apple. The video was made a few days ago and is up to 2.5 million views across platforms. I expect this video to get many millions more views over the coming days.\nIf people like it once, they'll like it again.\n## How I'll use this for sales\nI'm going to use this to hijack top-of-mind awareness for my SEO program, Compact Keywords , when I begin doing wide releases.\nVery simple strategy but one that works.\nJust like Alex Hormozi with Skool, I'll wear a Compact Keywords hat and shirt in my videos.\nAs I continue making near-guaranteed viral videos by using previously well-performing subject matter, many people will be reminded of my product or exposed to the name for the first time.\nThese days people need many touch points before they consider buying.\nThis will help get in reps for repeated exposure.\n## Can you use this?\nYou can!\nThis works for any content medium and all platforms.\nIf people like it once, they'll like it again."

    "text": "#### Jump Ahead\nFive cool af marketing things.\nIf you need some marketing inspo on this beautiful day, this one's for you.\n## Ranking for 200,000+ keywords with a less-than-one-year-old site\nThis Chrome Extension uses GPT to summarize YouTube videos.\nEvery time a user summarizes a video, a page gets created on their site with the AI-generated summary.\nThe company also uses GPT to:\n- Write the page title, meta description, and subtitle.\n- Classify and organize each summary so that they're all linked to from the footer with just a few clicks.\n- Recommend related summaries to keep people on the site.\nThey weren't ranking for anything for their first few months (launched December 2022). Then in late spring last year, they did a press push getting some good backlinks.\nThese backlinks propelled them to ranking for over 200,000 keywords with these AI-generated pages all within less than a year of first launching.\nThen, early this year, there was a Google AI penalization scare . Webmasters were getting all their properties penalized by Google even if only one used AI-text.\nSo this site, in fear, removed all their AI pages and subsequently lost all their rankings.\nRecently they relaunched their AI pages.\nNow they're ranking for 24,000 keywords - still within under 2 years of launching. Not bad.\nMy deep dive on this:\n## Clear copywriting\nThis guy went super viral early this year.\nHe took something customers didn't like - high delivery fees and apathetic delivery people - articulated it very clearly, then offered a solution so good people didn't believe it was real.\n- Clear, no-nonsense articulation of the problem: (\" Angry with absurd Uber Eats' fees? Want your DoorDash delivery person to care about you and your food? \").\n- Clear, no-nonsense explanation of the great solution: (\" I'll deliver for $5 \").\nHe's been completely booked since and now he's scaling with more delivery people and an app coming out for users in NYC, LA, and SF.\nI spoke to Tony on the phone. He told me how he made his flyer go viral . It's a good story.\n## $80,000 MRR with this faceless TikTok strategy\nThis was shared by @iamgdsa on X and then went viral.\nIt's unethical and immoral, but this is what's happening.\nApp developers are spending days finding relevant selfie-style TikToks of attractive people without many views.\nThey're taking these videos, shortening them to 2.5-second clips, and using them as hooks for their own TikToks, even making it look as if the people in the videos are recommending their apps.\nThe videos are downloaded without the TikTok watermark , and used without permission of the creators.\nTurns out this is super common . I've talked to a few developers now who are doing this because of the success of lots of other app developers.\nOne developer is doing this with a tanning mobile app and making $80,000 MRR with this strategy.\nIn fact, startups with well-known angel investors like Nikita Bier are even doing this .\nPodcast on this below:\n## Caleb Simpson's story\nThis is a good one because it's not an overnight success.\nBut it is somebody who found tremendous success.\nIt's the guy who goes around asking people how much they pay for rent and an apartment tour.\nThe short story is he spent years learning to make videos, finding mentors, and doing odd jobs to support himself.\nYears.\nNYC, where he lives, is an expensive place, and he would take whatever he could to pay rent and afford food.\nAfter several years he had the idea for what his niche became. \"Hey, how much do you pay for rent and could you give an apartment tour?\"\nInstead of making the videos himself, he tried to persuade an influencer friend into doing it.\nThe friend declined.\nThe principle here is make what you want to see.\nBut it wasn't easy.\nHe had to stage the first video because nobody would give him a tour.\nHowever, the idea was good and it took off immediately.\nAfter this he was getting DM'd by people wanting to give tours of their apartments.\nEven crazier, when he was really viral, he wanted to charge $120,000 for a single sponsored video. His manager said there's no way he could do that.\nHe fired his manager because he believed he could.\nHe got somebody who was aligned with his vision and successfully got paid $120,000 for a sponsored video.\nMake what you want to see and don't give up.\nPodcast on this below:\n## $10,000+ MRR with straightforward SEO on a simple app\nThere are lots of timer apps out there and this one - stagetimer.io - is making a name for itself with SEO.\nIt's making SEO landing pages for its timer in different scenarios that people would be searching for:\n- Professional timer for event productions.\n- Online timer for education.\n- Free countdown timer for esports tournaments and matches.\n- Easy-to-use timer for fitness classes, interval training, and workouts.\n- Free countdown timer for webinars.\n- So many more - spends a day making each page. There's not a lot of unique copy on each page.\nThis is known as bottom-of-funnel SEO and it's so powerful I've been working on an entire program about it since April - called Compact Keywords . In fact, I just started shipping an early version of the product and somebody told me, \"In video 3 and I'm like a 16 year old kid with a PS2!!! This is changing my whole concept of what I will do with the site man.\"\nStagetimer is doing the Compact Keywords method. Making landing pages targeting problems people are searching. Stagetimer is the solution to these problems.\nTheir MRR was shared as over $10,000 back in July . As their rankings have only increased since then, I'd bet their MRR has as well.\nCovered in depth in the Compact Keywords program .\nThanks for reading."

    "text": "On Instagram Reels and TikTok I have at least a few videos per month that each receive several million views. In fact, this month was my first month on Instagram surpassing 10 million views.\nOn YouTube Shorts however... crickets.\nUntil this week, that is.\nI had my first YouTube video in years get over a million views.\nAnd I almost did not upload this video.\nSo what you'll get in this article is:\n- How the video was iteration #3 of an idea I previously received validation on.\n- How somewhat disappointing performance on one platform does not mean the idea is bad.\n- Avoiding tons of views being left on the table.\n- My thoughts on automated posting with YouTube Shorts.\n## The first iteration\nMy first iteration went viral on TikTok with 3.2 million views , did not go viral on Instagram Reels , and, at 01:23 in length, was 23 seconds too long for YouTube Shorts.\nSo I instead repurposed it into a horizontal YouTube video , which only received 1,100 views.\nA few weeks later I was visiting Lithuania . It was my final day there, and I had a thought. \"I'm constantly in need of great subject matter for my daily podcast . I should use short form as a testing ground for subject matter to go deep on.\"\nAnd that's just what I did. Even though the video didn't go viral on Instagram Reels or YouTube horizontal, I believed the TikTok performance validated the story in the video as being interesting.\nSo I made this podcast on it. Aaaaand, it performed above average but it didn't go viral at all.\nI repeatedly received the same piece of feedback in the comments.\nInstead of being demoralized, I said, \"Alright, I'll make it in under 5 minutes.\"\nTo be honest, that was only half of what I said. The other half was, \"If people liked this story once on TikTok, I bet they'd like it again if told in a slightly different way.\"\nThis takes us to...\n## Iteration #3\nIteration #1 was short form. It used the green screen effect and lots of images from my source materials. It was a bit higher-production with all the images, highlights, and layering that went in.\nIteration #3 , also short form, had none of that. I had my script and I made the video with little effort. I used my phone to record my laptop which had images on it, and occasionally I flipped my phone around to record me speaking. I have a principle of putting my face in every video as I am the brand and doing this increases top-of-mind awareness and trust.\nIteration #3 was 01:09 in length. On TikTok so far it's received 41,000 views (whereas Iteration #1 on TikTok received 3,200,000 views). On Instagram Reels so far it's received 260,000 views (whereas Iteration #1 on Instagram Reels received 52,000 views).\nBut here's what's crazy.\nInstagram Reels, which has decent performance, took a couple of days to get momentum. Typically in my workflow I delete the footage and file the next day, only keeping the export.\nAs Instagram Reels didn't have great traction the next day, I almost deleted the video before shaving off the 9 seconds for YouTube Shorts (which has to be under one minute).\nIt wasn't much extra effort to shave off the 9 seconds, but since the traction wasn't yet overwhelming on either platform, I almost didn't do it.\nBut I did.\nThe YouTube Short came in at 59.95 seconds. I uploaded it to YouTube manually from my phone as that seems to make a difference in views compared to using an automation tool which uses shared IP addresses. For more on this, this is my exact social media posting directions .\nHere's the YouTube Short's growth and analytics so far (also interesting to see how long it took for the video to take off):\nTo recap, here are the view breakdowns:\nIteration #1 TikTok: 3,200,000 Instagram Reels: 52,000 YouTube Horizontal: 1,100\nIteration #2 YouTube Horizontal: 2,200\nIteration #3 TikTok: 41,000 Instagram Reels: 260,000 YouTube Shorts: 1,400,000\n## Update on removing 4,900 followers last week\nIf you didn't see, last week I removed 4,900 followers using Instagram's relatively new \"remove flagged for review followers\" feature .\nI wrote last week:\n- Engagement immediately went up... for what feels like all of my videos.\n- Instead of 4,900 flagged followers being removed, only 1,100 were removed.\nOne week later here's what I've seen:\n- I've repeatedly received prompts from Instagram to remove thousands more followers. Upon accepting, very few, if any, followers are actually removed. Others I've spoken with have also shared the same experience.\n- Others I've spoken with have also shared the same experience.\n- Average engagement continues to increase.\nAgain, nothing but good results with this feature.\nThat's all for this week's article - just because one platform doesn't like your content, doesn't necessarily mean it's bad."

    "text": "Three observations this week that are directly relevant to anybody doing SEO or social video.\nSections: YouTube SEO EMDs in SEO I removed 4,900 followers on Instagram. Here's what I found.\n## YouTube SEO is still crazy.\nI made this video about EMDs in SEO (if you don't know what EMDs are, don't worry, the next thing on this list describes it).\nI wanted to show up for the top-of-funnel search, \"EMDs in SEO.\"\nTop-of-funnel SEO through one's own website is competitive.\nTop-of-funnel SEO through UGC (user-generated content), especially YouTube, is a lot easier.\nIn my quest to have high top-of-mind awareness in SEO, I often think about what relevant keywords I can use in my video descriptions so that I'll take up more market share.\nIn this specific case, I made my video's title, \"EMDs in SEO - Exact Match Domains - are crazy.\" I made the first sentence of the video the same thing. Then I used the transcript from the video for the rest of the description.\nThis was 3 days ago.\n## EMDs in SEO are indeed crazy.\nEMD stands for exact match domain. This means you have a domain (yourwebsite.com) that exactly targets a keyword you want.\nHistorically, this has been seen as a controversial practice in SEO.\nIt works for many individual keywords, but on the other hand it's not good for brand (these days domains like this sound very spammy) and there are even indicators that Google's algorithms can demote sites just for having exact-match names.\nThe May 2024 Google Leak revealed that, \"Google has adjusted its algorithm to demote sites that rely solely on EMDs without providing substantial value. This prevents low-quality sites from gaming the system based on their domain names alone.\"\nAnd this is why the following finding was so crazy.\nA Semrush affiliate bought the exact match domain shown in the image below as well as relevant backlinks to the domain.\nThe domain also had a lot of content on it. You can view it with Wayback Machine here .\nThe result:\nThis EMD ranked #1 above Semrush for its own brand name. Crazy.\nThe domain no longer works, however.\nThis finding went viral across much of the SEO community and it's likely this goes against Semrush's affiliate ToS.\nSo not only does the domain no longer work, the backlinks have also been removed.\nNonetheless, this is a crazy example of EMDs working very well (until the SEO community blows it all up).\n## I removed 4,900 followers on Instagram. Here's what I found.\nInstagram has this feature for anybody with over 1,000 followers called, \"Remove flagged for review followers.\"\nAt 97,000 followers I had 4,900 marked as flagged.\nBefore deciding to remove them, I did a ton of research and found:\n- Very occasionally, way more followers are removed than Instagram predicts. Example : \"I did it and it removed 11k from my account, it only told me I had 5 spam accounts  don't do it.\"\n- The consensus, however, is that removing these flagged followers leads to increased engagement . \"One person used it and immediately had views increase by 300%. Another person used it and Reels that were previously getting 200 views got 2,000-7,000 views.\"\n- Still, people report this feature removing actual followers. \"Our list of 'flagged for review' contains mostly real people, where actual bot accounts are ignored by the tool  useless feature .\"\n- But... \"Flagged means bots\" and \"IG literally wants you to delete them... Definitely delete them. Listen to the IG overlords and do what it says.\"\n- I also read reports that it takes a week to see any change in engagement after doing this.\nI was overly cautious because sometimes doing things like this can mess up your algorithm and cause dramatically reduced views. For example, wrongly using the disavow tool in Google Search Console is known to harm rankings a ton.\nSo, after extensive research, I tried it yesterday.\nHere's what I found:\n- Engagement immediately went up... for what feels like all of my videos.\n- Instead of 4,900 flagged followers being removed, only 1,100 were removed.\nThat's it. Nothing but a good experience so far.\nNow I know my case isn't for everybody. A friend just removed 7,000 flagged followers from his 190,000 follower account and said he hasn't noticed anything good nor bad.\nBut personally, I've immediately noticed a positive difference and am hoping this will continue (as, again, this was yesterday).\nWith all that said.\nIt's been a good week.\nHope it's been a good week for you, too."

    "text": "At the beginning of this year I wrote about how I wanted to rank #1 on Google for \"growth hacking newsletter.\"\nNow I am consistently ranking #1 on Google for \"growth hacking newsletter.\"\nThis is exactly how I did it.\nBut first - to establish the playing field - there was some competition I had to overcome.\nThe competition was this:\nIt was the previous holder of my #1 position.\nIt has \"growth hackers\" in the URL, page title, meta description, and alt text. It uses the word \"newsletter\" too.\nIt has nearly twice as much SEO Domain Authority as me. At the time of writing, it has 67/100 whereas I have 34/100. Also, its individual newsletter page authority is 40/100, whereas mine is 26/100.\nSo it was not a guaranteed victory.\nBut here's why I thought I could beat it.\n- None of the pages ranking on Google were targeting the exact keyword directly. As this is something people search ( a lot more people than one would expect ) I said, I'll do it.\n- The Growth Hackers page, previously ranking #1, didn't have much on it (as you can see from the screenshot of the page above). I believed it wouldn't take much for me to create a page with a lower bounce rate. Also, with a better page title I believed I could have a higher clickthrough rate. These are two metrics Google deeply cares about.\nSo, my dear readers, here's what I did, and it did not take me very long.\nI pretty much left my newsletter landing page the same, actually.\nSeriously. I barely changed anything.\nAll I did was:\n## Directories\nI Googled \"newsletter directories\" and submitted my newsletter to a bunch of these directories with a description including the terms \"growth hacking\" and \"newsletter.\"\nThe Growth Hackers page I was competing with likely had links just like this too, given its niche. But what I did is I created a better mousetrap.\n## On-page optimization\nI added \"growth hacking newsletter\" to my existing newsletter landing page in the:\n- Page title.\n- Meta description.\n- Alt text.\n- Body text.\nOnce these things were done, I submitted my changes to Google Search Console .\nThen I began tracking the keyword in my SEO software.\nHere's what happened.\nEach bullet is a week.\nRight after making the changes, I showed up on page two of Google. The next week, I was on page one of Google.\nOn the 4th week, I ranked #2 for my keyword.\nIt stayed like this until July 10-I didn't make any further optimizations during this time.\nThen, on July 10th, again, without me doing anything extra, it ranked #1. Then it fluctuated.\nNow it is back at #1.\nGiven my page is more optimized for the keyword, likely has a lower bounce rate and higher clickthrough rate than the competition, I expect it to stay like this.\nAnd that's how I did it.\nAll in all, putting together this write up about how I did it has taken more time than actually doing it.\nThanks for reading!"

    "text": "These two digital marketing things got me hyped this week.\n## Grok 2.0\nX's Grok 2.0 will generate images of anybody doing anything .\nYou've probably seen the controversial images at this point.\nA few things to note:\n- This functionality rolled out to everybody on Thursday, 8/15/24.\n- It's already being patched. Some of the controversial prompts that worked Thursday no longer work.\n- If it is restricted to the extent OpenAI's image generation tool, DALLE, is then even more 'innocent' images like the heading image here will not be possible.\n- Midjourney isn't a great alternative as it has trouble with recognizable characters combined with familiar logos and text.\nWhich leaves us with how marketers have been using Grok 2.0 for the past few days:\n- Generating many images of familiar characters doing things in their niche. Examples: SEO. Shopping for shoes on Amazon. Drinking iced tea in a backyard. Plumbing. Fitness.\n- SEO.\n- Shopping for shoes on Amazon.\n- Drinking iced tea in a backyard.\n- Plumbing.\n- Fitness.\n- Marketers are making libraries of these images to use for future campaigns. The idea is this functionality won't last much longer. Marketers are creating these images while they still can. They're not having the characters use their products. They're having the characters involved in their niche.\n- The idea is this functionality won't last much longer. Marketers are creating these images while they still can.\n- They're not having the characters use their products. They're having the characters involved in their niche.\nI made a video about this:\n> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nA post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nSomebody commented, \"Marketers are still responsible for what they post. And if they get sued they'll hardly win a lawsuit by saying, 'But Grok let me generate it.'\" I responded, \"Marketers aren't putting their products in the images, nor are they saying they generated them. Regarding using famous characters - meme marketing is a real thing and many memes use famous people.\"\nHow to easily create these marketing images with Grok 2.0:\n- Have ChatGPT write the prompt for Grok 2.0. Tell ChatGPT, for example, \"Write a Midjourney prompt for 'Draw Thor played by Chris Hemsworth doing search engine optimization - he is sitting behind a computer, looking at the Google interface. The image is from the side making both Thor's face and the computer screen visible. The scene is set in Asgard.'\"\n- ChatGPT will write you a prompt. Put that prompt into Grok 2.0.\n- To go even harder, take the image from Grok 2.0, put it into Kling AI (which is free), and have ChatGPT write you a video prompt. \"Write a Kling AI video description for Thor doing search engine optimization.\" Here's what you get:\nMarketers are using these images and videos in Instagram/TikTok Carousel posts, stories, and Reels/TikToks/YouTube Shorts. The recognizable characters are easy sources of engagement and prime the viewers to think of the marketer's niche before the brand/product is shown.\n## Podcast Guesting\nI'm PodMatch's biggest affiliate and previously was one of their biggest power users. As I've shared before, I used it to go on 30 podcasts in 3 months.\nThen I stopped because my daily TikToks/IG Reels were getting so much more reach than podcasts.\nBut something I took for granted which I noticed only this week:\n- Google Images prefers pulling images from many different sources rather than one source. Images for me and my brands are populated by YouTube thumbnails from the podcasts I went on (even if the podcasts are very small) and from these podcasts' websites.\n- I actually got many more SEO backlinks than I realized. And these backlinks are going to pages that are now ranking.\n- You can somewhat control the anchor text you get for these links. By putting the keywords you care about next to the URLs you want podcasts to link to, they'll sometimes just use that anchor text.\nIt's no secret I've been working on a bottom-of-funnel SEO program, called Compact Keywords , since the beginning of April.\nAs the product is nearing completion, I'm making a long launch plan.\nSomething that I'm going to do again is podcast guesting. Why:\n- The benefits I previously mentioned. I'll be doing SEO for my SEO product. The links will help.\n- The podcast appearances will rank for the product brand name. This gives social proof.\n- I'll get further social proof when I share to my Instagram and TikTok stories me going on 2-3 podcasts a week.\n- More podcasts than before (I was going hard with PodMatch Q4 2022) do have legit/unique audiences for me to promote to.\nI don't often share my marketing plans. But this is one I'm very excited about so I thought maybe my energy would come through here and get you excited too. To try this yourself, here's my guide for how I got on so many podcasts.\nIf there's something you're working on / doing marketing for, this podcast plan, and Grok images, are fun."

Domain authority is simply a 1/100 score for how able a website is to rank on Google for its desired keywords.

I have a deeper explanation on Domain Authority here .\n- The website's brand was not well-known enough in the niche.\nSo here's one of the things that I did - and I love this and will be doing it again.\n- In almost every niche, there are professionals with pre-existing networks who want to guest write for relevant blogs. They want this because: They can share their guest articles on social media to flex and elevate their authority as a thought leader. Writing a post on LinkedIn Pulse isn't as cool as writing an article for an industry blog. This makes them more Googleable. They don't know how to check traffic scores and perceive any industry blog they come across as trafficked enough to be worth it.\n- They want this because: They can share their guest articles on social media to flex and elevate their authority as a thought leader.

Architecture article submission Economics article submission Psychology article submission Or more specific: Biomedical engineering article submission Pedagogy article submission Fintech article submission\n- Examples: Engineering article submission. Architecture article submission Economics article submission Psychology article submission\n- Engineering article submission.\n- Architecture article submission\n- Economics article submission\n- Psychology article submission\n- Or more specific: Biomedical engineering article submission Pedagogy article submission Fintech article submission\n- Biomedical engineering article submission\n- Pedagogy article submission\n- Fintech article submission\n- Each of those is a keyword. Each of those are things people search on Google.\n- Anyway, I ranked high for one of the more broad article submission terms.\n- I found my keyword \"[my niche] article submission.\" I put it in the URL slug (/[insert industry]-article-submission). In the Page Title. I wrote an appropriate Meta Description where I lied about how much traffic the blog had. I said \"Get read by thousands of [your niche] professionals, industry leaders, etc.\" The H1 was the keyword, \"[My Niche] + Article Submission.\"\n- I put it in the URL slug (/[insert industry]-article-submission).\n- In the Page Title.\n- I wrote an appropriate Meta Description where I lied about how much traffic the blog had. I said \"Get read by thousands of [your niche] professionals, industry leaders, etc.\"\n- The H1 was the keyword, \"[My Niche] + Article Submission.\"\n- I wrote relevant details on the page as well as submission guidelines. Total word count was (still is) 562 words.\n- I put a call to action at the top of the page which took the visitor to a form at the bottom.\n- I used a heading image I grabbed from Unsplash / Pexels /etc. for free.\n- I submitted the page to Google Search Console .\n- That's it! I track all my keywords through Moz, though there's tons of great SEO tools out there. According to my historical data (this was years ago), it took 8 weeks after publishing to rank on the first page of Google. I didn't drive any backlinks to the specific page. We just published more articles, bottom of funnel SEO landing pages , and worked on improving the web app.\n## Oh there was one more thing.\n- Again, this was years ago and I didn't have experience with outsourcing or even knowledge of how inexpensive it would have been to outsource a qualified SEO editor. So... I was editing everything myself.\n- But - no professional was going to take this seriously if the owner of the site was also editor of the guest blog (people were checking on LinkedIn). A serious publication has multiple writers and editors. So what did I do?\n- I made a fake editor!\n- I created a fake editor with a fake name and fake profile photo. I used Photoshop to warp the face of somebody in the background of a photo I was in. The warped face was grainy (the photo was from a dark bar), but it looked like a real face (nothing like the original). I gave the editor a Twitter profile so if you Googled her she would appear plausibly real (people actually added her on Twitter).\n## And it worked!\n- Actual notable professionals in our niche came across this page via Google and submitted guest articles.\n- They communicated with me (via the fake editor).\n- They often checked out the web app and some found it useful enough to become users and share with their networks.\n- They shared their articles on LinkedIn, boosting their authority and our exposure.\n- I even had the stroke of genius to make templated images of them with a quote of theirs, our logo, and their face - to make sharing very easy. The background of the image would be another of these free stock photos from Unsplash/Pexels. It looked good and guest writers would share.\n- Oh, and writers sometimes had their own personal websites, so they would link to us and give us backlinks, further upping our Domain Authority.\n## The one problem\n- The one problem was that while we received a lot of good stuff, we also received a lot of junk. Poorly written content. Unoriginal content. Straight up plagiarized content (you can check with Copyscape ). Content the author had used elsewhere (again you can check with Copyscape).\n- Poorly written content.\n- Unoriginal content.\n- Straight up plagiarized content (you can check with Copyscape ).\n- Content the author had used elsewhere (again you can check with Copyscape).\n- So it was a time suck for me.\n## How I handled this\n- I edited everything myself. It was a lot. A lot.\n- The good stuff we featured in our main Featured section.\n- The bad stuff we hid with a click or two deeper into the site. We branded this section \"Columns\" so it sounded cool. This way organic readers (we actually got organic recurring readers) wouldn't see the bad stuff, but professionals could still share they were mentioned in our blog and share/backlink to us.\n## Will I do this again?\nTotally!\nOnce Compact Keywords releases - my SEO product which I've been working on for the last couple of months - I'll start this strategy up again.\nExcept this time I know better. I will get a real editor. Not a fake editor made up by me. A real one.\nBut everything else I shared in my previous strategy, I will keep. Though maybe I'll do a custom heading image with MidJourney, TBD.\nAnyway, I love this strategy. It's a fun one that can be used for pretty much any niche.\nAnd it elevates brand, top-of-mind awareness, and SEO Domain Authority."

Honestly, feels even crazier just writing it.\nI even got to meet Steve Forbes.\nI got a seat up front and learned some awesome things from some awesome guests.\nThis article is some of those things I learned.\n## Ryan Reynolds\nRyan Reynolds was last to speak. He spoke for about 30 minutes and said so much good stuff.\nThe heading image of this article is a few pictures I took of him.\nI made a video about how he uses storytelling in his marketing. The video's up to 1.2 million views.\nHere's what he said (watch him say it in my video here or read it below):\nStorytelling is one of the most undervalued tools in scaling businesses.\nMost of the people in this room have forgotten more about investing money in the last 30 seconds than I will ever know in my entire life. But the thing I will bet on 10 times out of ten is emotional investment.\nTo me, emotional investment can fortify a business or a brand in really interesting and unique ways.\nIf your brand has an emotional connection with culture, with its audience/consumer then you have a moat that is around your brand, making it incredibly resilient, something that could inevitably become timeless.\nBrands that sort of lack an identity or a stance, they're much more vulnerable to the changing financial landscape.\nI actually believe Ryan Reynolds' business acumen is pretty solid and not due only to his preexisting fame. This is from Yahoo Finance , \"His ventures he co-owns or sold, spanning various industries, are collectively valued at approximately $14 billion, according to Forbes. His portfolio includes an F1 team, a football club, an alcohol brand, a wireless provider and an advertising agency.\"\nSomething else he does well is what Ryan Holiday, author of the legendary marketing book Trust Me, I'm Lying , calls newsjacking. This is a very reliable strategy for getting attention.\nRyan Reynolds calls it Fastvertising . Here's him explaining it (watch here or read it below).\nIf you can create something that speaks to a cultural moment, which is something we call Fastvertising at my marketing company, the talk around the proverbial digital water cooler might be whatever happened in the news two days ago, but if you can hijack that moment with your brand, suddenly your brand becomes the digital water cooler conversation.\nYou want people to share your story.\nIn order for them to share the story of your brand, they want to feel like they have some authorship.\nIt really is a unique way to judo that energy.\nI'm actually doing newsjacking/fastvertising with this article. Ryan Reynolds is trending now because of the release of Deadpool & Wolverine two days ago. I just used Ryan Reynolds' trending status to make this article more culturally relevant and more engaging.\n## Jay Penske\nGoogle Search is a huge place and there's tons of opportunity. From DemandSage :\n- Google caters to 8.5 billion searches every day, which is equivalent to 99,000 search queries every second.\n- 15% of Google searches are unique, which constitutes 1.275 billion unique queries every day.\nWith this said, the law of the vital few, otherwise known as the Pareto Principle, also applies to Google. 20% of companies get 80% of the clicks and within that 20% there's only 16 companies that really dominate.\nThis image is from one of my favorite SEO sites, Detailed.com. They have a famous article, \" How 16 Companies are Dominating the World's Google Search Results (2024 Edition) .\"\nHow is this related to the Forbes Iconoclast Summit?\nOne of the speakers was Jay Penske, founder of PMC in the top right corner of the above image.\nHere's how big PMC is:\nPMC successfully owns and operates an ever-growing constellation of iconic brands, which includes Variety, Rolling Stone, The Hollywood Reporter, Billboard, Billboard Music Charts, WWD, SHE Media, Robb Report, Deadline, Sportico, BGR, ARTnews, Fairchild Media, Vibe, IndieWire, Dirt, Artforum, Gold Derby, Spy.com and Luminate, the premier music SAS data and analytics company. Penske Media also owns Dick Clark Productions (DCP) the world's largest producer and owner of televised live entertainment programming, which includes the Academy of Country Music Awards, Golden Globe Awards, American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, New Year's Rockin Eve, Streamy Awards, and television programs such as So You Think You Can Dance. In addition, PMC owns several vital cultural events such as SXSW, LA3C, Life is Beautiful, Latin Music Week and ATX Television Festival. In addition, Penske Media is the largest shareholder of Vox Media. - From the PMC website .\nI really loved what Jay Penske, the founder, said.\nBill Gates says the same thing, \"Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.\"\nHere's what Jay Penske said (watch here , read below):\nWhen you have a long trajectory - you really believe you want to own this business 25-50 years from now - you're making decisions that are so much healthier for the near-term success of these brands.\nI'm out for building not fleeting businesses, but generational assets.\nWhat really stood out here is how he said the best way to get short-term successes is to have a long-term mindset and to choose things you'd be happy working on for a long time.\nAnd he followed his own advice. He founded PMC 19 years ago.\n## Jon Gray\nJon Gray is the President of Blackstone (not to be confused with BlackRock), a private equity firm with over $1 trillion assets under management.\nA hot topic at the event (and everywhere else) was AI. Every speaker was asked about AI.\nI thought Jon Gray had an interesting response (watch here , read below):\nIf you think about AI, the physical manifestation is the data center. We own across our portfolio companies, either existing or under construction $50 billion, we have another $50 billion of data centers in various stages of development.\nThis is driven by the demand from the major tech companies. We did a big $7.5 billion loan for a data center cloud company. We're trying to find all these derivative plays. At our portfolio companies, we've been using predictive AI, which is basically numbers in, numbers out for a long time.\nWe have a large data scientist team with 50 plus people who help companies think about pricing and staffing and so forth. We, like everybody else, are trying to figure out how to use generative AI. How to use the images, the sounds. We own a company, Ancestry, the family history business. Imagine typing in your name, not just seeing a two dimensional thing, but some sort of movie created, sound, the newspapers of that day, the whole thing pulled together quickly. Think about the tools for software and other media businesses. I would say for us, like everybody, we're moving quickly to try to figure it out, but there's a long way to go.\nThe predictive stuff was much easier. We're trying to make the use case across our companies with generative AI.\nEverybody today is thinking about AI.\nBut I think it's rare to get the perspective of somebody who literally manages over a trillion dollars and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of AI data centers.\n## More speakers\nIf you liked this, I'll be sharing more I learned from this event in future articles. The speaker list was crazy:\nRyan Reynolds, Vinod Khosla, Steve Forbes, Jonathan Gray, Michael Strahan, Lindsey Vonn, Nelson Griggs, Jay Penske, David M. Rubenstein, Mary Callahan Erdoes, Andreas Halvorsen, Dambisa Moyo, Harvey M. Schwartz, Todd Boehly, Moira Forbes, Randall Lane, Steven Bertoni, Maneet Ahuja, Sonia Gardner, and many more.\nAnd here's a TL;DR of the lessons in this article:\n- Use storytelling in your marketing.\n- Capitalize off trending events to get more visibility, engagement, and word of mouth.\n- Predictive analysis AI is hyper-useful for making money. Generative AI is hyper-useful for getting engagement.\n- My favorite lesson: Think long-term. Ridiculously, obnoxiously long-term. Paradoxically, it's the best way to get short-term success."

You got 10. Maybe more. Seriously. You got perhaps over ten viral videos from getting your first viral video.\n## 1.2 million views\nHere's what happened:\nFor the fourth time in its existence, I reposted a viral video I made last year.\nI want to preface this:\nI made this video about Google Search Console in about five minutes.\nI made it in August of last year, 2023.\nI made it on an iPhone 8 with an iPhone 8 camera.\nThe video ends with the line \"It's 2023 and somehow people still don't know about this decade-old tool.\"\nIt got 956,000 views on its first posting.\nSince then, I posted it 2 more times, maybe more, on Instagram.\nEach time it did well, but I hadn't posted it in a while and I wanted to see if it would still do well.\nI wasn't sure that it would, to be honest.\nReposts of my viral videos have done well in the past, but...\nIt's been nearly a year after this Google Search Console video was made.\nThe resolution is poor compared to my videos today.\nAnd I freaking state in the video that it is 2023!\nSo I post the video a few days ago on Monday...\nAt the time of writing, the reposted video is up to 1.2 million views, lol.\nI literally state at the end of the video that it is 2023, but the video is engaging, informative, and useful enough that it's up to 1.2 million views.\n## Why I'm so bullish on this\nHere's why I'm so ridiculously bullish on this:\n- Not only do I have a huge library of viral videos from posting every day for the last 629 days (yes, without missing a single day).\n- Not only do I firmly believe anybody can do this. It took me 2 months posting several videos a day every day before having my first viral video. I think I posted over 100 videos on TikTok before my first one went viral. By the way, if you want some real inspiration, MrBeast just became the most subscribed YouTube channel with 300 million subscribers-but this was his subscriber special when he hit only 300 subscribers-11 years ago. How much has his content improved since then?\n- By the way, if you want some real inspiration, MrBeast just became the most subscribed YouTube channel with 300 million subscribers-but this was his subscriber special when he hit only 300 subscribers-11 years ago.

Quick example. This is an affiliate video I made. It's gone viral four or five times now, I've lost count. Here's an article I wrote last year about how much money the video made . This video went viral twice, sharing my soon to be released product-Compact Keywords-as well as an SEO affiliate product. I'll be posting it again. And again, and again.\n- Quick example.

    "text": "LinkedIn video is getting turbocharged.\nI had my best performing LinkedIn post (from any of my LinkedIn pages) to date - and it was from a company page with only 36 followers.\nThe company page had all my videos coming out to it as soon as each video was published on TikTok (with my automation through Repurpose).\nCompare this to my personal LinkedIn, with over 3,000 followers - where my videos were not regularly released.\nAnd match this with the fact that rumors are swirling around LinkedIn prioritizing video in the feed.\nAgain, all 1,200+ of my videos had been coming out to this company page with few followers... for over a year and a half... with little movement only until there were unconfirmed rumors of LinkedIn prioritizing video.\nSo, if you add this all together.\nIt would seem we have more than just rumors.\nAnd this isn't just a one-off thing.\nA few days before my best performing LinkedIn post , I had another video post from this company page nearly reach my previous personal record for impressions on LinkedIn.\n## How this is changing my LinkedIn strategy\nWhen I started making videos a year and a half ago, my videos sucked.\nI didn't know anything about hooks.\nAbout what left a viewer feeling fulfilled.\nAbout editing.\nReally, my videos were not good. I was hyped to get a few hundred views on any given TikTok.\nBut I said I'm going to make and post videos daily because I'm sure it's like anything in life: you get better with practice.\nSince my videos sucked, though, I didn't want them coming out to my personal LinkedIn. I didn't have any data on whether or not they were good enough to deluge my existing LinkedIn followers with.\nBut I still wanted them to come out on LinkedIn. I didn't want to leave views on the table.\nSo I made a company page and used my Repurpose automation (mentioned above) to automatically have them publish there without the TikTok watermark.\nLinkedIn's new prioritization of video has me reconsidering this.\nAs I type this, I literally spent the last hour looking at other video creator LinkedIns.\nI looked at friends who make videos 3-5 videos a week for TikTok and IG Reels and have hundreds of thousands of followers. And friends who do daily videos.\nThey have all their videos release to their personal LinkedIns.\nHowever... the fastest way to grow on Instagram and TikTok is high frequency posting - posting 4+ times a day.\nSo I wondered, will this be okay on LinkedIn too?\nI looked at Gary Vaynerchuk's LinkedIn with 6 million followers.\nHe posts 6 times a day.\nAfter seeing this, I changed my automation to release my videos to my personal page (with most of my followers) instead of my company page.\nDone with Repurpose .\nFrom what I can tell, LinkedIn follows the same rules as everywhere else:\n- If your content is valuable, it will be appreciated.\n- Hooks work.\n- Most people won't see a piece of content the first time.\n- Repeatedly reposting your content works.\n- If you're not putting up content, people will forget about you.\n## How you can use this\nI'm bullish on short-form vertical video because it's used everywhere.\nIf you're not making video , consider starting.\nThings you don't need for giving value through daily short-form vertical video:\n- Good lighting.\n- A microphone.\n- A quiet room.\n- Sophisticated editing software.\n- A good camera (I got my early audience (Nov 2022 - Oct 2023) shooting on the selfie camera of an iPhone 8).\n- More than five minutes a day. I used to shoot and edit my videos in the TikTok app. I made this in under 5 minutes, and it got 2 million views. Since it performed well, I repost it every couple of months, so it's gotten millions more views.\n- I used to shoot and edit my videos in the TikTok app. I made this in under 5 minutes, and it got 2 million views. Since it performed well, I repost it every couple of months, so it's gotten millions more views.\nHere's my exact social media posting directions if you'd like to start.\nIf you are making video:\n- And it's not validated by getting views on TikTok/Instagram/YouTube Shorts, have it auto publish to a new LinkedIn Page. If a post unexpectedly performs well, share it to your personal LinkedIn Page.\n- If it is validated by performing consistently well (or you just believe in the content), have it auto publish to your personal LinkedIn like I'm doing.\nThat's it.\nThat's how to maximize LinkedIn's new focus on video content."

    "text": "When I started doing SEO, there was so much information I was learning that I was overwhelmed.\nI didn't know what was important and what wasn't.\nAt one point I spent weeks worrying about schema markup ; this turned out not to matter.\nAt another point, I tried learning the nuances of the rel=\"canonical\" attribute. This especially doesn't matter as much now with top-of-funnel content so often being stolen and put on Reddit .\nNow, years later, I've learned that SEO, like everything in life, abides by the Pareto Principle.\nYou get 80% results from 20% effort.\nSo here's a good deal of this 20%.\n## Technical SEO\nGoogle Search Console is Google's proprietary tool for accessing its search index. It's pretty easy to use.\nConnect it to your site.\nThen find your sitemaps. Different content management systems and plugins have different ways of generating a sitemap in case you don't have one.\nSubmit said sitemap(s) to Google Search Console.\nWhenever you add a new page to your site or edit one, submit the URL to Google Search Console as well. Do this in the top bar that says \"Inspect any URL in...\"\nThat takes care of the most pressing aspects of technical SEO.\n## When does serious technical SEO matter?\nIt matters if:\n- You're not using a user-friendly CMS or builder like Webflow, Elementor or other WordPress site builders, SEO plugins like Yoast, Wix, Squarespace, Weebly, and more.\n- You're doing programmatic SEO .\n- You're developing your own web app.\n- You're doing a migration .\nIf you're not doing those things, you don't really have to worry about technical SEO.\nNow that that's out of the way, what should you worry about?\n## What content to target\nThis is a simple trick for finding out what content to target.\nGo to Google Search Console.\nGo to Performance > Search Results > Export (to your choice: CSV, Sheets, Excel).\nSee what keywords you're already ranking for.\nLook for ones not in the top positions but between positions 6 and 25. These are low-hanging fruit . There are two ways to target them.\n## How to target keywords with an existing page\nFor keywords ranking on page 1 or at the top of page 2 of Google, use Google Search Console to see which page is ranking for the low-hanging fruit keyword.\nGo to Performance > Search Results > Toggle On \"Average Position\" > Queries > Click on the keyword > Then click \"Pages\" to see which page ranks for it.\nAdd more text to the section on the page where the keyword is mentioned. If the exact keyword is not directly mentioned, use it and add a few extra sentences about it.\nFor keywords ranking between positions 11-25, create individual pages targeting these keywords. Then link to these pages from the page that is ranking for them.\nYou will also need a dedicated page targeting keywords that are more competitive (meaning many authoritative sites ranking for the keyword). You can use the MozBar for free to see the SEO Domain Authority of websites. It's on a scale of 0-100. The higher the number, the higher the authority.\n## How to target keywords with a dedicated page\nThe following is 70% of on-page SEO. I learned this personally, but I also recently heard it from a guy who did over 400 on-page SEO experiments. After 400 of these rigorous experiments, he learned this too.\nPut your target keyword in the: - Page title - Meta description - URL - H1 - Beginning of the first sentence\nThat's it.\n## Bottom-of-funnel keywords\nTargeting top-of-funnel keywords is generally a waste . If you avoid that, you'll avoid years of unnecessary work.\nInstead, you should target keywords at the bottom of the funnel .\nThese are easier, higher converting , and require less work.\nDon't go after \"What is Collaboration Software.\" Instead, go after \"Collaboration Software with Intuitive Learning.\"\nHow to find bottom-of-funnel keywords?\nAn easy way to start is to use any SEO tool to see what keywords competitors are ranking for.\nLook for keywords that are a solution to a problem.\n\"Collaboration Software with Intuitive Learning\" is a solution to many problems. \"What is Collaboration Software\" is a question, not a solution. Don't target questions.\nBottom-of-funnel keywords are so important to modern-day SEO I have an entire product about them - Compact Keywords . I show in detail with video how to do everything in this article, how to find these keywords, target them with pages on your site or with video, track your results, make updates, get backlinks, and so much more. There's also my SEO templates for you to copy and adapt for your business.\nYou can start with the landing page , which gives more examples of what bottom-of-funnel keywords are and why they are significantly better than everything else.\n## Backlinks\nYou don't need a lot of SEO Domain Authority to go after bottom-of-funnel keywords, which are better.\nSo here are three easy ways to get enough backlinks to start.\nIf you have a new site, this will get your SEO Domain Authority from 0 - 20.\nIf you don't have a new site, Featured has a high acceptance rate for journalist pitches. The site is journalists looking for expert sources to answer questions. If you're accepted, you get links in the journalists' articles.\nI have a ~75% success rate on there.\nGenerally, look for directories in your niche. Submit your site to these directories. Use rich descriptions. These descriptions help tell Google what your niche is.\n## Wrapping\nThere are tons of SEO tricks, which I mention all the time, but the reality of SEO is that like most things in life, 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort.\nThe greatest shortcut is knowing what not to do and the small simple areas to focus on instead."

    "text": "Much of my audience found me through my short-form mobile videos, lots of which focus on SEO.\nBut what if I told you short-form video is also the fastest and easiest way to rank on Google?\nWell, that's what I tested this week.\nThe theory is that Google is turbocharging UGC (user-generated content) in its results.\nThis is because people trust blogs less, mainly due to there being so much AI-generated misinformation. Forums and UGC have become more trusted.\nMost SEOs only discuss written UGC because they are too afraid or unwilling to learn how to create engaging short-form video content.\nBut this is actually often preferred by searchers.\nA several-second video:\n- Is more engaging than a written result.\n- Takes less time to understand than a written result.\n- Has comments so that: The author can be challenged . More details can be shared by the commenters .\n- The author can be challenged .\n- More details can be shared by the commenters .\nThe comments are key . Most articles lack commenters, which makes it harder for readers to get extra information or sources of truth.\nUGC platforms all have comments.\nAnd video is easy to consume.\n## Something I noticed\nI noticed many of my videos ranking on Google for 2-3 word keywords.\nGoogle was pulling my videos from TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.\nIt was typically only pulling videos that had decent engagement.\n## So here's what I tried\nThe day after my observation, I made a post about link echoes. I wanted to rank for 'link echoes seo.'\nIt was late. I spent an hour total shooting, editing, and uploading my video.\nIn the first sentence of my video description, I wrote, \"Link Echoes, aka Link Ghosts - the positive SEO effects of backlinks remain forever.\"\n## The results\nThe video was engaging enough :\n- 18,200 views on Instagram Reels and 7 comments.\n- 4,441 views on YouTube Shorts and 3 comments.\n- 1,600 views on TikTok and 0 comments.\n24 hours after posting the video, it was ranking #1 on Google for \"link echoes seo.\"\nInitial test successful.\n## Test 2\nI went to the Forbes Iconoclast Summit on Thursday. Around 150 guests and over 20 trillion dollars in assets under management at this event.\nRyan Reynolds was the last speaker to go on.\nI had a seat up front and made a video about what he talked about: his marketing.\nI put \"Ryan Reynolds Marketing Strategy\" at the beginning of the description for my video.\nI went to sleep.\nThe next morning my video was literally ranking #1 on Google for \"Ryan Reynolds Marketing Strategy.\"\n## White hat\nI'm going to test more, but if this theory is true, this will be a white hat way to quickly rank for keywords.\nWhy white hat? Because if your video isn't good enough to get engagement, it won't rank.\nTheoretically, you can make an engaging video and put your keyword in the opening sentence, and this will work for a short while, but it's pointless. Where do you put the CTA for your brand? Not in the rest of the description. Not in the content of the unrelated video without reducing its quality.\nCan this be exploited? No. If somebody uses an engaging video to rank for an irrelevant keyword, the searchers will bounce, and the video will be deranked. And if this happens too often for a social media account, that account's posts will stop being shown in the search results.\nSo it's hard to do this in an against-the-rules way.\nLike I said I'm going to continue running tests.\nBut this is promising so far.\n## Why this is amazing\nLet me put this in perspective real fast.\nA normal SEO might spend days, weeks, or even months making the content to rank for a keyword.\nThen another days, weeks, and months waiting for said content to rank.\nI spent an hour making the content. And 24 hours waiting for it to rank #1."

    "text": "Google's biggest leak to date was two weeks ago.\nI was one of the first to cover it and made this 34-minute podcast on it. My most popular podcast yet.\nOne of the most interesting things about the leak is how it confirms SEO experiments that Google reps previously called \"made-up crap.\"\nThe leak shows many ranking factors that Google still uses or used in the past - things they said they didn't/couldn't measure.\nNow, it's important to state that we don't have the weights associated with the factors; however, there are so many experiments out there that show what is important and what is not.\nSo, in this article, I'll share some things learned from SEO experiments over the years.\n## Click data\nRand Fishkin, who is primarily responsible for popularizing the leak, used to do many SEO experiments with his large audience.\nHis experiments with click velocity are especially interesting.\nIn two separate experiments, he:\n- Tweeted out instructions to his audience of hundreds of thousands.\n- Told them to Google a specific keyword and click on a specific result at the bottom of Page 1 of Google.\n- Got several hundred clicks in 3 hours. Experiment 1: 228 clicks. Experiment 2: 375 clicks.\n- Experiment 1: 228 clicks.\n- Experiment 2: 375 clicks.\n- Had both pages go from the bottom of Page 1 of Google to the #1 spot as a result.\nHe then repeated this on other separate occasions. More people tested this too. Everybody confirmed Rand Fishkin's findings.\nThen a Google rep said, \"Dwell time, CTR, whatever Fishkin's new theory is, those are generally made-up crap.\"\nRand, naturally, took this personally. When he published his article about the \"leaked Google Search API documents,\" he said, \"In their early years, Google's search team recognized a need for full clickstream data (every URL visited by a browser) for a large percent of web users to improve their search engine's result quality.\" This \"clickstream data served as the key motivation for the creation of the Chrome browser.\"\nMakes sense, though.\nTikTok and Instagram recommend content based on engagement and user intent satisfaction. Why wouldn't Google want to do the same?\nThis is interesting information, but it's important to keep this in mind:\n## Content stealing\nI made a podcast about this this morning at 7 AM. This was my studio for the podcast:\nSEO Dan Petrovic tested copying others' content and putting it on higher Domain Authority websites without permission.\nIn all 4 of his tests, the higher Domain Authority ( what SEO Domain Authority is ) sites ranked above the original content.\nCrazy.\nThen, the good news. Dan got a warning in his Google Search Console and had to take down the pages.\nBut that takes us to today, where this no longer matters.\nPeople are now doing this on User-Generated Content websites where there are fewer bad consequences for getting caught.\nAND Google is making it easy to do this:\n> Reddit is outranking you, even for your own content, because of THREE different factors, with the last being the one most people in SEO have NO idea about... 1 - For the last ~9 months, Google has been on what feels like a god given mission to turbocharge UGC signals... You see... pic.twitter.com/lnY1CwGcfp - Charles Floate  (@Charles_SEO) March 12, 2024\nReddit is outranking you, even for your own content, because of THREE different factors, with the last being the one most people in SEO have NO idea about... 1 - For the last ~9 months, Google has been on what feels like a god given mission to turbocharge UGC signals... You see... pic.twitter.com/lnY1CwGcfp\nThe TLDR of that tweet is that Google is boosting User-Generated Content websites like Reddit and doesn't care where the content originated from.\nIt's doing this because searchers trust User-Generated Content sites more than blogs. The clickthrough rate on Reddit (which the previous click tests show is important) is higher.\n## Okay, should you try this?\nI'm sharing this because for savvy digital marketers or anyone learning digital marketing, this knowledge is important to have. It's vital to understand how the internet works. This information is even significant in the age of ChatGPT and Gemini as LLMs internally rank data based on similar metrics Google uses to recommend websites.\nEven social media algorithms like IG and TikTok mirror Google's Search algorithm in various ways.\nUnderstanding how content algorithms work and what they value is so, so important.\nBut I'm not going to advocate black hat tactics because they could easily backfire.\nFor example, you could try doing the Reddit stuff mentioned above, get caught, and have your brand and any mentions of it shadow-banned on Reddit. That'd be bad .\nGoogle could do a deal with Reddit where they get IP addresses, Chrome data, and more data of users, and match that to webmasters and consultants on a Google Search Console property. Then black hat tactics done improperly could be tracked back not just to a company , but to the Google users and identities themselves. This would make it harder to do various businesses in the future on platforms that share this sort of data.\nThat'd be bad too.\nSo it's important to understand how these things work.\nBut it's also important to understand that the consequences of being dumb are high.\nFor now, brands are doing this to skirt these consequences - basically going through 3rd parties without any trace of connection to the original brand.\nBut it's still worth treading in this area with a healthy amount of paranoia about what's possible and what the consequences could be.\nAs for me, I play the long game and don't have to look over my shoulder.\nSo, my dear readers, I'll leave you with this.\nIt's another podcast I made that people seemed to really like. It's about how to do SEO in a white hat way after what has been learned from Google Leak."

Others like them.\nPeople watch our videos because we share interesting advice, facts, knowledge, stories, and experiences.\nNot because we dance or show beautiful scenes like houses and landscapes.\nWhat I've noticed\nPeople like us who talk - I'm the only one who uses music in most of my videos.\nI do it just because I like music, but not because there's a deliberate strategy.\nBut I spend a lot of time choosing music, so I need a deliberate strategy to save time.\nWhen it's appropriate to choose music\nI think I should choose music when I want to convey an emotion.\nOr I can see what music TikTok recommends, and if the recommendation adds an emotion I didn't realize I wanted, I can use that, too. Often, TikTok will recommend a piece of music where the drop times perfectly with my drop-that seems to work well.\nHere's an example where the drop in TikTok's recommended music timed perfectly with my drop. This video got 2.5 million views on TikTok and 2 million on Instagram .\nHowever, many of my simply recorded (on my phone, with little editing) videos with no music do very well.\nI think no music puts emphasis on what's being said.\nBad music takes the emphasis off.\nGood music can add emphasis and attention.\nHere's a video where TikTok surprised me by making my video seem magical and whimsical. You can imagine that without music, it would not seem this way. The video did way better than expected (I made it in 5 minutes), especially on Instagram .\nMusic is great for stories. Definitely stories.\nThis is my best-performing video ever. It's a story. The music in it is so good .\nMusic works to add drama and anticipation.\nIt works to make things funny.\nBut for pure advice and hot takes, there are only a few choices of music that work for that.\nSo my note to myself is\nBefore looking at TikTok's music recommendations, ask what you want the vibe to be.\nIf you can come up with an answer, look for a piece of music that supports that.\nIf you can't, look at the music recommendations and see if anything adds emphasis .\nIf nothing in particular gives an extra flair, don't use music."

    "text": "Over the last few days, I made both a TikTok/Reel and a podcast about this, but there was something I should have mentioned. Something important.\nThe story is about a gym owner whose business is doing $1,000,000 ARR with a YouTube channel of 450 subscribers. The YouTube plays a big part in it .\nHere's the Instagram Reel about it. If you haven't seen this, I think it's quite good.\n> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nA post shared by Edward Sturm (@edward.builds)\nIn short, this guy Jay, sells personalized fitness coaching. He has a gym (Hale Fitness) and he has trainers.\nThe following strategy worked so well that Jay:\n- Raised prices.\n- Shortened sales calls from 45 minutes to 15 minutes.\n- Has a waiting list of months; too much demand.\n- Expects to soon make way more than $1,000,000/year.\n## The strategy\nThe strategy in a nutshell:\n- Prospect sees paid ad. Here's one of them, which I found through the Meta Ad Library .\n- The ad goes to a landing page with a video at the top. The prospect is instructed to start with the video, which is 41 seconds and is of Jay explaining the upcoming form and sales call.\n- Prospect fills out the form. There are questions to group prospects into archetypes.\n- At the end of the form, the prospect sets up a sales call for typically two days into the future.\n- The day before the call, a sales rep looks at the answers and figures out which archetype the prospect falls into. The gym's YouTube channel has few subscribers, but it has many videos for every different archetype. The videos are of trainers speaking and explaining fitness/nutrition/lifestyle themes. The day before the call, the prospect is sent a video that matches their archetype, addresses the biggest problem the prospect specified in the form, and offers a solution. The videos provide direct value. Oftentimes , this will even be enough for prospects to binge other videos on YouTube.\n- Oftentimes , this will even be enough for prospects to binge other videos on YouTube.\n- Sales call happens the next day. Close rate from this strategy is a whopping 50%.\n- For remaining half that doesn't close, they're given a 24 hour discount and 1-3 more videos of people like them getting the results they want. This closes many more.\n## The part I left out\nThat's how the strategy works.\nBut I didn't explain why it works so well and what we can take away from this.\nThis is from Jay himself about these warm-up videos:\nFor example, if I have a mom who's in her mid-40s, then we'll send her a video that talks about how to handle menopause.\nOr if I have a man who's in his mid-30s, I'm going to send him a video about what to do if you feel like you're too late in life.\nI know that if I have a male that is like me, he's going to want to see me in the video.\nI know that if I have a woman who's like one of our female coaches, they're going to want to see her in the video.\nI try to send videos that are specific to the problem each person has.\nIn short, the videos are hyper-personalized .\nThe prospects are made comfortable and confident feeling like this gym understands and empathizes with them. Then the videos go above and beyond offering value and solutions right there, for free.\n## Takeaways\nFor anybody doing sales calls, the takeaways are straightforward:\n- Get as much info on your prospects as possible before the calls. Consider using a thorough form like Jay's. For this part of his stack, Jay uses Typeform.\n- Make videos of you talking about people like your prospects.\n- Address their problems.\n- Offer solutions.\n- Use your face.\n- Host all the videos on YouTube so viewers can binge other videos on the channel. This further increases close rate before the call.\n- Send prospects a targeted video a day before the sales call.\nAgain, for Jay, the above was good enough to get his close rate ( on cold traffic ) to 50%.\nOkay, but what if you're not doing sales calls? Start with always trying to have a prospect in mind. Who are you speaking to with your marketing?\nIf you're selling a product and not doing calls:\n- Consider putting videos on your landing page.\n- Make several videos for different buyer personas.\n- Explain the problems these personas have and address how the product will help them.\n- If possible, give free advice in which the buyer doesn't even need your product - this builds trust that you're genuine about trying to help.\nHow about if you have a minimal website and you're mainly selling through a social media account:\n- Similar to the above. Make videos addressing different personas.\n- If TikTok, use hashtags to target these personas. If Instagram, use keywords instead of hashtags .\n- Use your face if possible.\n## What it comes down to\nI loved Jay's story because there are aspects all of us can apply in what we're doing.\nAt the top-most-level:\nBe empathetic.\nGive value before trying to close.\nAnd personalize."

More of a meritocracy of content, similar to TikTok.\n- The Head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, has been making a bunch of Reels and Stories about this.

My theory is that the algorithm works in waves both for users and for the retention of creators. Some quarters, new creators get more views to increase their follower counts and get them addicted. Other quarters, creators with bigger followings get more views to increase their activity. What this means for you: if you don't have many followers, you have a higher chance of having your content seen on Instagram than before. The algorithm is more accommodating to those who are just starting and learning.

Nobody does this, so it's an easy way to stand out. This will be most prevalent on the Gmail mobile app, where the default view shows the icons. Gmail has a \"53% market share in the United States\" and \"in the US, 97% of Gmail users access their accounts on mobile devices, while only 3% use a desktop.\" Very meaningful. To do this, just replace your Google icon (under 'Manage your Google Account') with a GIF.

I'm always looking for best practices for ideation. You could spend the same time, money, and effort on two pieces of content. Typically, the one that performs better is the one that is more thoughtfully ideated. I make videos daily. On Thursday, I said to myself, \"I'm going to sit down and brainstorm hooks, not subject matter. Just the most engaging hooks I can think of.\" I ended up only writing one hook. The first hook I came up with got me inspired. I wrote the whole script immediately after coming up with that hook. The video made from that script took me 12 minutes to shoot and 30 minutes to edit. The video just surpassed 250K views and keeps going. It's also made a bunch of affiliate sales on a product that gives me 40 % commission. It's a product I was going to recommend anyway (I'm a testimonial on its landing page) , but since they have an affiliate program, I just used my affiliate link.\n- I'm always looking for best practices for ideation.

I buy short, memorable domains and redirect them to the longer links.

It says the price to advertise on BetaList for a day is $99. In 2019, that was the price. Now it is $999.\nEven crazier, Google's own AI, Gemini, knows this :\nNot to mention, when it comes to launching on BetaList (not advertising) the price is $300.\nSo much about this article is wrong but it's being overvalued because it once had high engagement and now has a recent date published.\nBy the way, launching on BetaList for $300 is a steal. This is from my marketing journal on the day I first tried BetaList (the price was $129 back then):\nThis was for our product Reverb, which was originally named Speek.\nI was nomadding through Belarus and using BetaList and Product Hunt to get users all throughout the United States.\nThat BetaList launch got us users for weeks and had us written about in several US edtech blogs.\nThe backlinks from those edtech blogs set the foundation for the SEO I did for Reverb, which is how I learned Bottom-of-Funnel SEO.\nBut back to BetaList - $300 for that launch also would have been completely worth it.\nAnd finally, back to SEO, changing your date published to this year is about as quick a win as you can get. I'd recommend updating any facts that are out of date, but as I just showed, it looks like Google doesn't care.\nOnce you update, just make sure you submit to Google Search Console afterward."

The searcher knows what they're looking for, they just don't know the brand that will give it to them. The conversion rate on these keywords is high as f*ck.\n\"Enterprise Collaboration Software\" - Exploring a bit. Trying to learn about collaboration software for large companies.\n\"What is Collaboration Software\" - Almost no conversions from this type of keyword. It's completely exploratory.\n## Put a different way:\nBottom-of-funnel: Collaboration Software with Intuitive Learning Middle-of-funnel: Enterprise Collaboration Software Top-of-funnel: What is Collaboration Software\n## So why compact?\nThere's a sort of magic to compact keywords.\nThis is why they are compact:\n- Very low competition\n- Low average words per page required to rank high, ~415\n- Low effort required; you can templatize and reuse sections across pages\n- Less domain authority and quality backlinks required to rank high\n- Lower search volumes\nBecause these keywords are so use/purchase-oriented, they tend to be very specific.\nThis high specificity gives them lower search volumes.\nThese lower search volumes give them lower competition.\nAnd that's the magic:\n- High converting\n- Less competitive\n- Requires less work\n## Waking up\nTop-of-funnel, non-compact keywords, have higher search volumes and are recommended by most idiot/newbie SEOs for that reason.\nThese idiot SEOs think those keywords are sexy, when in reality they:\n- Require 2,000-3,000+ words to rank for\n- Don't convert immediately\n- Are competitive\nIt gets worse...\nChatGTP, Gemini, and other generative AI chatbots are answering top/middle-of-funnel questions. Searchers are no longer going to blogs to get their answers.\nGoogle's recent update is prioritizing Reddit and Quora for top/middle-of-funnel content over blogs.\n> Every content site I can think of has been obliterated by u/newmes in SEO\nThe thing that's left is what digital marketers are calling \"demand generation keywords.\" I call them compact keywords. Bottom-of-funnel keywords. Purchase-intent keywords.\nAND these keywords even work with AI chatbots.\nIf you ask ChatGPT for \"collaboration software with intuitive learning\" it will pattern match to the website that has a page for \"collaboration software with intuitive learning.\"\nSo it's magic.\nThe last bastion of SEO. And one that's not going to vanish any time soon.\nThe real trick to SEO isn't head vs. long-tail keywords. It's compact vs. non-compact. Purchase-intent vs. exploratory.\nTarget keywords that are down the funnel - Compact Keywords - and you will work less and make more.\nBTW - if you need a complete basics of SEO article, this is my SEO foundations article (it's short). And this is the very first SEO resource I read when I was just starting out (it's long) ."

Most other social platforms do. This makes it an ideal testing ground for hooks and video scripts. Neil Patel writes 3 scripts a day on TwitterX and turns the best one into a video for TikTok, Instagram Reels, etc. He also posts the best one on LinkedIn. If you don't have enough followers to test hooks and concepts, TwitterX ads still give incredible reach for little cost. Several of Neil's best scripts each month are turned into blog posts. 1-2 of the best ones each month are turned into webinars. Something I've noticed - whenever I read viral marketing/business Tweets on TikTok and Instagram Reels, the video always goes viral. Example . What I'm trying: I turned off my TikTok to TwitterX automation. Instead, I'm posting the transcript of the TikTok to TwitterX every day. My editor, Descript, automatically transcribes my videos, so I always have the transcripts ready to go without additional work . It's a simple copy and paste. My theory is that TwitterX prefers short text posts over short video posts and my video transcripts will do well as text posts. I'm also considering taking any TikTok that got over 50,000 views and using that transcript as a post on LinkedIn.\n- TwitterX doesn't suppress an account's reach for posting boring content.

    "text": "Time and time again, I'm reminded:\nIt's not about how hard you're willing to work.\nIt's about the risks you're willing to take.\nThis story is going viral on TikTok.\nI just made a podcast a bout it.\nBut I want to share the full thing here.\nIt's a story of running out of money then using smart guerrilla marketing to launch a freaking tequila brand.\nNot a software product with a lot of room for error.\nNot a course or something where the only costs involved are time and small SaaS subscriptions.\nA brand new tequila brand. In the highly saturated market of the UK.\nHere's the story.\n## Pimentae Tequila\n- We have our protagonists: Alice Parmiter and Wynter Karo. They met in university and became friends.\n- 2.5 years before founding Pimentae, they vacationed in Mexico. Had a blast and noticed one critical thing:\n- There was a big knowledge gap in how to consume tequila due to the UK and US's shot culture. The UK drinks 84,000 margaritas a month, but the ones in the supermarkets are full of sugar or don't taste proper.\n- 2.5 years later. It's COVID. The world is in lockdown. Alice and Wynter are neighbors in an apartment building. They both have corporate jobs.\n- They're spending their lockdown evenings on their balconies, talking, and having margaritas. They say, \"These margaritas are terrible compared to the ones in Mexico. Let's fix this.\"\n- They don't wait to start. They begin building the same evening that they excitedly have the idea.\n- As their corporate side hustle, they build Pimentae Tequila. It uses premium tequila, agave instead of sugar, and higher quality ingredients than what's normal. They found a factory in Scotland to use. They have an artist hand paint the branding. They design their bottles. They make the website with Shopify. They get ready to launch. And........... they run out of money.\n- It uses premium tequila, agave instead of sugar, and higher quality ingredients than what's normal.\n- They found a factory in Scotland to use.\n- They have an artist hand paint the branding.\n- They design their bottles.\n- They make the website with Shopify.\n- They get ready to launch.\n- And........... they run out of money.\n- That's right. Right before launch, they run out of their personal savings, which they had been putting into the project. They even put all their corporate paychecks into the project. But they need to launch, and they're out of money.\n- Big brands might put in $50,000-$100,000 or more into a launch like this - doing some fancy activation. Not Alice and Wynter, though. They don't have that.\n- Their target influencers are all at home. It's still lockdowns. The bars are closed. You can't publicly talk about going out and socializing. The influencers need content; they need things to talk about. Our protagonists get an idea.\n- Alice and Wynter DM 50 of their target influencers. They send a quirky message sharing what they've built and their story. They ask if they can hand deliver the new tequila to them. 30 of the 50 influencers say yes and give their addresses.\n- Alice and Wynter put together 30 hampers with the tequila, their nice bottles, images of them building the company, custom ice cube trays, and nice packaging. Everything is designed to look good, so it will be shareable on Instagram.\n- They go around hand-delivering the hampers. They have several things going for them. A unique quality product. A good story. Authenticity. Nice packaging. Reciprocity. The influencers need content.\n- A unique quality product.\n- A good story.\n- Authenticity.\n- Nice packaging.\n- Reciprocity.\n- The influencers need content.\n- Alice and Wynter are hoping at least a few influencers will share. Not hoping, depending. They're out of money. They're depending on it.\n- The first influencer to share is the biggest one. Alice and Wynter are at a McDonald's drive through when this happens, exhausted, and checking their phones nonstop. This is a great sign. But will more influencers share? Soon after the first one, the rest of the 30 influencers all go on to share.\n- The Pimentae Shopify isn't configured properly at the beginning. They miss out on an hour of sales at launch. They fix it, and then...\n- They sell out of all their inventory.\n- They quit their corporate jobs.\n- They drive up and down the UK, attending events and trade shows.\n- They hire a cocktail van to drive to press houses around London.\n- They sell at bigger and bigger festivals. In the podcast, I share a story of how they completely outsell Patron at one festival.\n- 18 months after launching, Selfridges and Fenwicks, chains of upscale department stores in the UK, agree to stock them.\n- They raise investment and use the money to launch into cans.\n- But it doesn't end here. One week ago, they put up this TikTok . It tells a lot of what I shared here. It has pictures of Alice and Wynter. It's authentic and relatable. It uses uplifting unique music. It has a Hero's Journey vibe. The TikTok cost nothing to make. And...\n- This TikTok gets 1.5 million views (+ it will likely get millions more). They can also reuse it on Instagram to get many more views.\nJust like with the Bobbi Althoff story , playing to win is not about how hard you're willing to work. It's about the risks you're willing to take."

    "text": "A few months ago, we nearly doubled the price of one of our SaaS companies.\nWe were charging $5/month/user. We increased it to $9/month/user.\nAsk me if it decreased customer acquisition.\nAsk me if it decreased LTV.\nYou don't have to ask.\nYou already know the answer.\nIt didn't.\nThis article is about increasing price.\nTim Ferriss once asked investor, Marc Andreessen, what he would put on a billboard. Marc's response:\nRight in the heart of San Francisco would be a billboard with just two words on it:\n\"Raise Prices.\"\nThe number one theme with our portfolio companies that are struggling is they're not charging enough.\nIt has become absolutely conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley that the way to succeed is to price your product as low as possible under the theory that if it's low-priced everybody can buy it and that's how you get the volume.\nAnd we just see over and over and over again people failing with that because they get into the problem we call \"Too hungry to eat.\"\nThey don't charge enough for their product to be able to afford the sales and marketing required to get people to buy it.\nThey can't afford to hire the sales rep to go sell the product.\nThey don't have enough ad spend, whatever it is.\nThey cannot afford to go acquire the customers.\nPeople will pay more.\nHere's one more quote.\nThis is something I used to share a ton with friends when I discovered it back while living in Rome.\nIt was crazy.\nI was on a train to Florence with a good friend. We were going for a day trip.\nI listened to this episode of the Indie Hackers podcast on the way there.\nThe guest was Patrick McKenzie , who's now an advisor to Stripe.\nHe gave an eye-opening story:\nIt would have been great if someone had told me to charge more.\nWhen I was working at a Japanese day job, I worked at a company that was essentially a consultancy.\nIt's called a systems integrator in Japan, but whatever. Modeled like an engineering consultancy.\nAnd I'm just an engineer, I have no connection to the business side, but I knew what my charge-out rate was.\nIt was approximately $100 an hour.\nI didn't make anything close to $100 an hour, but I thought, if I start a consultancy, then I can make 100% of my charge-out rate: 100 bucks an hour. Awesome.\nThen I spoke to - by the way, this is the importance of having friends who are a few steps down the road from you - I made a buddy on Hacker News, Thomas Ptacek, and he told me, \"You shouldn't charge hourly for consulting, you should charge weekly for consulting. So, whatever your rate is right now, multiply it by 40. That's your new week rate. And people can't buy hourly blocks. They have to commit to a week.\"\nAnd so I started doing that, started selling $4,000/week engagements, and after one of those, I decided that four grand was way too low relative to the value I was creating for larger software companies.\nI said, \"Okay, my new rate is $8,000/week.\"\nAnd people still bought it.\nThen, for the next engagement I was pitching to a company, they sent me a one-sentence email: \"Quote me your rate for two weeks.\"\nI said, \"Well, my rate for one week is $8,000, so two weeks is $16,000.\" And I had my finger over the send button, and I said, \"Wait. What's the worst thing that happens if I type in $12,000? They say it's too high? You'll have another of these emails coming from somebody else in another week or two.\" So backspace, backspace, backspace.\n\"$12,000, $24,000 respectively.\"\nHit Send.\nAnd then I had a panic attack because I thought, \"Who could charge $12,000 for a week? I don't even know what I'm doing. How are they going to react to that? Am I going to lose a friendship over this? Blah blah blah.\"\nI got a reply back five minutes later: \"Wow, that's a healthy rate. Okay.\"\nAnd that's the last time that consulting client ever even mentioned rate as a discussion.\nSo six months later, new engagement, my stock rate is $20,000/week. New client goes, \"Okay.\"\nAnd then a year or two after that, my stock rate is $30,000. New client goes, \"Pricey, okay.\"\nI did put $125,000 a week for 10 weeks on a proposal once, and got very far away down the line on that proposal, but that didn't happen.\nI remember sitting on the train looking at the rolling Italian hillside in disbelief at that story.\nPatrick didn't 2x his prices.\nHe didn't 4x his prices.\nHe more than 7x'd his prices! And almost 31x'd his prices.\nSo wild.\n\"Raise prices\""

    "text": "The Inside Story of How Tony Delivers Manufactured Virality With No Marketing Budget\nHow Tony Delivers went from ideation to filled capacity in a week after launching using only free viral marketing.\n4 weeks ago, Tony Delivers was an idea with no waitlist, no marketing budget, and no existing following to launch to.\n3 weeks ago, Tony Delivers had launched and was entirely at capacity.\nCurrently, Tony Delivers is getting backlinks from some of the most authoritative websites on the Internet.\nSo, in this article, you will read:\n- Tony Delivers' crazy guerrilla marketing story.\n- How the news cycle works.\n- What no-budget viral marketing does for SEO.\n## Tony Delivers' crazy guerrilla marketing story.\n- For years, Tony did Uber Eats deliveries as a side gig in cities like LA and SF. When he had the idea for Tony Delivers, one month ago, he was in Seattle.\n- He made six iterations of the flyer below. The one you're seeing is #5. Shaan Puri gave a great breakdown of this flyer in his newsletter, Small Boy : There's more marketing skill in this fugly flyer than you'll find on all of LinkedIn. Starts with the emotional problem: (\" Angry with absurd Uber Eats' fees?\" ). Clear, no-brainer solution: (\"I'll deliver for $5\"). Catchy Name: (\"Tony Delivers\"). Clear value comparison: (DoorDash / Uber Eats' prices vs. Tony Delivers). Clear CTA: Scan this code with your phone.\n- There's more marketing skill in this fugly flyer than you'll find on all of LinkedIn.\n- Starts with the emotional problem: (\" Angry with absurd Uber Eats' fees?\" ).\n- Clear, no-brainer solution: (\"I'll deliver for $5\").\n- Catchy Name: (\"Tony Delivers\").\n- Clear value comparison: (DoorDash / Uber Eats' prices vs. Tony Delivers).\n- Clear CTA: Scan this code with your phone.\n- Now that Tony Delivers is going viral, everybody is reporting on how brilliant the flyer is and how \"no-brainer\" the idea is. But nobody is reporting on how Tony distributed the flyer . You could have the best business in the world, but without smart distribution, it will take a while for people to hear about it.\n- Tony prints out 300 copies of the flyer. He spends 4 days hanging them around the area of the Amazon offices in Seattle - the spheres. Tony said, \"I believed not only my customers would be there, but people who would share the flyer would also be there.\"\n- On days 4-5, three things happen. Somebody who sees the flyer shares it on the Seattle subreddit. It is quickly voted to the top of the subreddit. A journalist from The Stranger, a local publication, comes across the flyer in real life. The journalist shares it on the publication's website and Instagram. The Instagram post gets a lot of views. Some guy with only 4,300 followers on TwitterX sees the Instagram post and shares the flyer too. The TwitterX post of it gets 6.4 million views .\n- Somebody who sees the flyer shares it on the Seattle subreddit.

The TwitterX post of it gets 6.4 million views .\n- Reddit wasn't enough to get Tony Delivers to capacity because many people thought the offer was too good to be true. They didn't believe it was real.\n- 2 days after the TwitterX and Instagram posts, demand for Tony Delivers is well over capacity . \"I need a faster bike now,\" Tony told me.\n## How the news cycle works.\n- 2 people see the flyer in real life. They share it online. This leads to another person making a viral TwitterX post.\n- It doesn't stop there. People who see the above posts make posts themselves. They share and report on Tony Delivers because it is an interesting story.\n- Tony Delivers gets on local news, national news, niche news, and more.\n- Here's how I found out about Tony Delivers. Chris Bakke, a well-known entrepreneur, sees one of the posts or articles about it. He shares it on Twitter saying, \"Just invested $300M at $1.1B post into Tony Delivers.\" This gets 1 million views. Shaan Puri shares Chris Bakke's post in his newsletter. I make a video about Tony Delivers. My video is up to 250,000 views across TikTok and Instagram.\n- Chris Bakke, a well-known entrepreneur, sees one of the posts or articles about it.

Credit to Chris Bakke for the discover and 5 Tweet Tuesday for the breakdown. #buildinpublic #MarketingSuccess #MarketingTips #copywriting  Sigma - FLEXXONE Beats\n- Tony DM's me. He says:\n- Tony DM's me. He says:\n- We have a great call. I did not expect Tony's story to be so good.\n- We have a great call. I did not expect Tony's story to be so good.\n- The news cycle doesn't stop. In the next few days, there will be stories in Business Insider, Weekend Magazine, and Morning Brew.\n## What no-budget viral marketing does for SEO.\n- The next part, I explained to Tony on our call.\n- Tony is now getting SEO backlinks from some of the most authoritative publications. His website, Tonydelivers.co , is becoming valuable.\n- A lot of people go viral, get many backlinks, don't realize the value of this, get tired of the business, ditch it, and then stop paying for the URL. They don't realize the URL has value because of the many authoritative websites linking to it. Backlinks, in SEO, are when one website links to another. The more authoritative the linking website, the more this tells Google the website being linked to is, itself, authoritative. This authority ( called Domain Authority ) is what gives websites the power to rank high on Google. This is why backlinks are so valuable.\n- Backlinks, in SEO, are when one website links to another. The more authoritative the linking website, the more this tells Google the website being linked to is, itself, authoritative. This authority ( called Domain Authority ) is what gives websites the power to rank high on Google. This is why backlinks are so valuable.\n- Tony can use the SEO authority his website has to launch new offerings in the food and beverage space. He can target purchase-intent keywords to quickly show up to people who know what they want to buy but don't know the brand that will sell it to them.\n- Alternatively, he can sell the website to a company in his niche that wants to do SEO. This company will 301 redirect the Tony Delivers domain to their domain, transferring its SEO authority to their own website. All they will need is a relevant landing page for this transfer.\n- Tony can also 301 redirect Tony Delivers to a new business of his own in the space. There are many opportunities.\nFor more, here's my podcast on Tony's story:\n## So what's the lesson here?\nYou don't need a budget to:\n- Get backlinks worth tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n- Go viral.\n- Fill capacity.\nAll you need is:\n- A good offer or story.\n- Smart distribution of that offer or story.\n- And maybe a funny fugly flyer.\nTony Delivered."

    "text": "I want to set the scene.\nIt's the end of April 2020.\nLockdowns started a month and a half ago.\nI've been traveling for the past year and am now living in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nTraveling, I developed a tradition. Whenever I arrived in a new city, I would message 1st and 2nd degree connections on LinkedIn, asking to have coffee. No agenda at all. I just enjoyed meeting people.\nI met with incredible people this way, even billionaires:\n> @build_in_public Who I met pushing my comfort zone in Prague. #digitalnomad #livingabroad #networkingtips #linkedintips  Storytelling - Adriel\nNo more of that, though.\nWith a month and a half of shelter in place, I'm really missing networking.\nThe learnings I get, the friendships I make, the opportunities created...\nLike all of us, I'm spending all day on my computer. I start checking Product Hunt frequently for cool apps, and one day, I come across something called Lunchclub.\nIt's free. You submit your LinkedIn. They approve you. Then, you can start meeting people from their community.\n\"Sounds interesting,\" I think.\nI try it, wondering if I'll get approved.\nI do.\n## Lunchclub\nIf you're not in places like NYC, San Francisco, Miami, etc, or don't have a preexisting great network, it's generally hard to meet with established people ( unless you do this ).\nAnd even in these cities, you still may not have access to people like this.\nBut Lunchclub was magic.\nIt brought together successful and interesting people from around the world, though heavily in the United States, who just wanted to talk to and learn from each other.\nThe premise was, and still is, simple:\n- You make a profile, give your socials, and write a short bio.\n- You say the times you're available.\n- Lunchclub's algorithms connect you with likeminded people.\n- You're automatically scheduled for a one-hour video chat with somebody you'd like.\nStarved for the types of fascinating conversations I was having before lockdowns, I really hoped this would work.\nAnd did it?\nIt did.\nIt worked well.\nIn my first month , here are only some of the people I had calls with (in chronological order from my marketing journal):\n- Head of Global Marketing at Ralph Lauren.\n- Global Brand Solutions Lead at Google.\n- Contributors to Forbes, Cointelegraph, and more.\n- Entrepreneurs with exits.\n- Brand Director for Beats by Dre.\n- VCs.\n- Angels.\n- Head of Programming at SXSW.\nAfter every one of those calls, I would feel energized and excited. I was having such great conversations, learning so much, and meeting people I vibed with.\nYears later, I still keep in touch with many of these people.\nBut like I said, that was only my first month using it. The following months were just as good. We got employees through this, investment tips (the NFT hype cycle was just beginning), articles written about us, and more.\nSo Lunchclub is the tool I'm sharing in this week's article.\n## Is Lunchclub still active?\nI'm going to be honest, I seldom network now.\nI put out at least one video a day. A podcast a day. This newsletter each week.\nI don't have much time, and if there's somebody I want to meet, this brand I've created helps me meet them.\nSidenote: anybody can make the brand I did. My secret is just that I'm consistent and don't miss a day, no matter what. Here are my lessons from a year straight of posting on TikTok .\nBut if I had more time, I'd be on Lunchclub, especially while continuing to travel (sending this from a small city in Poland).\nI looked into it before writing this email. I can see that it's still active, and people were messaging me on it all throughout last year:\nSo I think it's a worthwhile share, especially if you're not in a New York, San Francisco, Miami, Austin, etc.\nIt's 2024 - we should be able to meet cool people from anywhere.\nWith Lunchclub we can.\nIt's free, so I don't get anything substantial from this, but this is my personal invite code for anybody who'd like to try."

    "text": "I have some big content, SEO, and marketing hacks in this article.\nI made an episode about each of these on my daily growth hacking podcast.\nIn this email, I'm going to share the TL;DL (too long, didn't listen) about what I'm doing and how you can do it, too.\n## I'm outsourcing my video strategy for $248/month, and you can do it too\n What I'm doing:\n- I recently met with two 22-year-old security guards in Poland. They work full-time and are paid $7,500/year.\n- Importantly, they're TikTok-fluent.\n- Their average work week is 40 hours. $7,500/year is $144/week. ~$3.6/hour.\n- I'm paying them $62/week to put up one video a day promoting one of my companies. It's under 75 minutes of work a day. 7-10 hours/week. ~$6.88/hour.\n- The content is simple and templatized. We're copying the affiliate strategy of competitors, which gets tens of millions of views a month.\n- The content comes out primarily on TikTok and is automatically syndicated to all other social media platforms through this software .\n- TikTok and other platforms push the content out for us, so we don't need to run promotion on it.\n- Remember, it does not have to take much time to go viral . Here's how I made a video in 15 minutes that got the tool it was for (the repurposing tool above), millions of views, and tens of thousands of dollars in MRR . Here's how I made three videos in 75 minutes about an AI experiment of ours. One of the three videos got 67,000 views, which turned into 3,100 users in a single day .\n- Here's how I made a video in 15 minutes that got the tool it was for (the repurposing tool above), millions of views, and tens of thousands of dollars in MRR .\n- Here's how I made three videos in 75 minutes about an AI experiment of ours. One of the three videos got 67,000 views, which turned into 3,100 users in a single day .\n How you can do it:\n- Search \"video editor\" or \"video editing\" on Instagram. DM people not in North America or Western Europe. I'm messaged by several video editors every day who are outside NA and Western Europe. They all told me this $62/week 7-10 hours/week gig is a good deal.\n- Don't be intimidated by high follower counts - most of the time, these people are buying fake followers so they can charge more. Check the comments on their Reels to see if followers are fake. If all comments are in the same format, the followers are fake.\n- This could apply to other creative jobs too, such as SEO writers.\n- Do faceless content. Copy affiliates for competitors or competitors themselves, and more.\n- There are many other content methods. Something simple and fast is to record 30 pieces of video of the product/brand. Take 20 related videos from YouTube (Google \"save YouTube video\"). Then, mix these up with different music and captions. This affiliate channel does this masterfully.\n- Ensure the account uses TikTok for at least 5-15 minutes daily. We have found that accounts that don't follow anybody and don't watch/engage with others' content get no reach . TikTok wants to reward accounts that are part of its ecosystem.\n Full details (11:18 minutes): Spotify | Apple Podcasts | TwitterX\n## I have two cheap, easy ways to get backlinks to new websites\n What I'm doing:\n- In search engine optimization, backlinks are life. The amount and quality of them determines how much lucrative traffic you can get from Google. Backlinks are so important that they even allow some websites to copy exactly the content of other websites and rank above the websites they copy .\n- There are many new websites I'll be starting. I will quickly get to >20/100 domain authority with the two tools below. This score is enough to rank for a good deal of keywords.\n- Tool one: This mass directory submission for $67. You pay $67 and get your website listed in many authoritative places. It takes only a few hours and applies to all sorts of brands (not just technology brands).\n- Tool two: One month of Featured.com for $99. Featured connects journalists needing quotes to experts. Submit a quote, get chosen, and get a backlink. Submit one quote a day on Featured and get many links. My quote acceptance rate is a whopping 78%.\n How you can do it:\n- If you have a new site, use the two tools recommended above.\n Full details (8:46 minutes): Spotify | Apple Podcasts | TwitterX\n## Bonus: The full story of how I hacked Meetup.com and used this to meet with the CTO of Uber and get wild leverage to talk with whoever I wanted\nThis one is directly actionable with things you can copy today.\nI recorded the below podcast explaining everything a few days ago.\n Full details (8:00 minutes): Spotify | Apple Podcasts | TwitterX"

    "text": "My belief on life is people are too quick to give up.\nSometimes it takes repetition to find success.\nHere are two examples.\n## The best backlink I got\nQuick refresher - backlinks (one site linking to another) give a website authority in the eyes of Google. This makes the website show up for keywords (things people search) on Google. The higher the authority of the website giving you the backlink, the better.\nMoz gives a 1/100 authority rating to every website.\nHARO (Help A Reporter Out) connects journalists to experts. Currently, HARO is entirely free to use.\nYou tell HARO which industries are important to you, and each day, HARO sends you emails with journalists requesting quotes from experts.\nIf your quote is selected, it appears in the journalist's publication.\nIn September 2022, I was living in Romania and working on getting backlinks to our self-improvement app, Commit Club.\nEach day, I would dedicate a bit of time to this by responding to one journalist's query.\nI did this every day for 30 days. I got a bunch of backlinks, but one really moved the needle.\nHealthline used my quote and linked to Commit Club with a \"dofollow\" backlink (this type of backlink passes SEO juice, whereas \"nofollow\" backlinks do not).\nFirst, Healthline is a top website. 91/100 domain authority is ridiculously high - Facebook, for example, is 96.\nSecond, this top website is in our niche - health and wellness.\nWhat did this do for us? This single backlink, within a week of getting it , increased the rankings of our keywords so much that, to this day, our SEO brings us users without me doing anything.\nThe SEO funnel, years after setting it up, just runs on autopilot. People find our app and try it.\nHowever, I would not have gotten this had I not committed to repetition. I responded to one journalist query daily for 30 days in a row.\nSometimes it takes repetition to find success.\n## Making the most viewed video in the world on the Silicon Valley Bank Collapse\nIn March 2023, I was living in Warsaw, and I was a few months into making videos every single day.\nMarch 10th, the Silicon Valley Bank Collapse began trending.\nI committed to making four videos a day on the topic for as long as the collapse was trending (this turned out to be ~3 days).\nMost of these videos got tens of thousands of views because the topic was so hot.\nBut one became the most viewed video on the subject.\n> @build_in_public Reading Bing AI's explanation of the SVB collapse in \"monkey banana terms.\" Cred to Skirano. #svb #siliconvalleybank #technews #bingai  Lo-Fi analog beat - Gloveity\nIt was possibly my laziest video on the collapse (I just read a viral tweet about it), and I made it right before going to bed.\nI woke up the next morning to the video at 500,000 views, and over the course of the day, it kept increasing rapidly.\nNow, across all platforms, it's probably gotten around ~10,000,000 views.\nSide note, for anybody outside the United States who feels stuck and thinks their location is a blocker to their success - this video I made from my living room in Poland was being shared with top founders, investors, angels, bankers, etc, in San Francisco, NYC, Miami, Austin, and all the top tech hubs.\nI had funded founder friends all over the world saying their friends were sharing the video in their group chats, not knowing they knew me.\nAnd it increased my followers tremendously - to the point where a few months later, I was recognized at an NYC tech event by somebody who first came across my content from that video.\nOh, and this person gave me Instagram advice , which I still use.\nBut this wouldn't have happened had I not committed to multiple tries.\nHere's another example: I made three consecutive videos about a weekend AI app we released. Two-thirds of the videos failed, but one went viral enough to get the app 3,100 users in a single day .\nMost people don't commit.\nSometimes it takes repetition to find success."

    "text": "Many marketers have heard of the MozBar Chrome extension .\nFew use it properly.\nI use this free tool to de-scam scammers, figure out where I'm likely to win with little effort (and where I'm not), and discern the legitimacy of business people I meet who talk a big game.\nThe MozBar is an SEO tool, but only half of my uses for it are SEO.\nIf you've never used an SEO tool, this will be extremely useful.\nIf you have used an SEO tool, or even this exact tool, the way I use the MozBar still offers some differentiation from how others use it.\n## Domain and page authority\nMoz has two useful SEO 1/100 scores called \"domain authority\" and \"page authority.\" Authority increases when more websites link to a domain or page. Authority is valuable because it boosts the clicks you get from search engines by ranking your pages higher.\nDomain = Edwardsturm.com Page = Edwardsturm.com/newsletter\nIf the Wall Street Journal links to your domain or page, that tells Google your domain or page is authoritative. This boosts the 1/100 SEO scores.\nImportantly, these scores value the scores of the websites that link to you. You want links from websites with the highest scores.\n## What I use this for\nI use this to discern:\n- The strength of my websites.\n- The strength of competitors.\n- The effort I should exert to appear on a website to get a link. I'll put more effort into a website or page that has a high authority as this is more valuable.\n- The legitimacy of sites I'm on. Scammy websites typically will have very low domain authority: <10 . Likewise, people may claim they have highly trafficked websites. If authority is low, this could suggest they are exaggerating or lying .\nThere are two factors that will make a website show in Google above another:\n- Better targeting of a search term.\n- Higher page/domain authority.\nThe MozBar shows this for free.\nMy favorite way to see domain authority is in the score next to the URL bar.\nWhenever I'm on a website, it shows the website's 1/100 domain score.\nThis is the quickest way to double-check that you're not on a cloned site of the site you meant to be on (a duplicate scam). Double-check you're in the right place if the number is low.\nThis is also the quickest way to see if a business person is exaggerating the noteworthiness of their business. This isn't perfect because some people like their dealings to remain private, but if somebody claims they have a lot of press or notoriety - and this number is low - it's likely they are exaggerating .\nPeople who don't know about SEO will make these lies, thinking they can go undetected. I think it's a cool skill to be able to see what's really up.\nAlso, looking at domain authority is a better measure of legitimacy than looking at traffic estimates from Similarweb or HypeStat, which are more likely to be inaccurate.\n## Understanding the Internet at a glance\nThis tool gives a bird's-eye view of the domain and page authorities of everything that appears when you search on Google.\nThis is an easy way to see how competitive a search term is.\nIf everything that shows up has high scores and has the search term in the title, then it's going to be competitive. You'll need a high domain authority score yourself and will also need to target the search term exactly.\nHigh scores, but no exact search term in the titles - easier.\nHigh and low scores and no exact search terms in the titles - low-hanging fruit. If you don't have high domain authority, you can still target the search term directly and show up for it.\nAnd how do you target the search term directly?\nThe general rule of thumb is to put the search term in:\n- The page title;\n- The URL;\n- The meta description;\n- The first alt text;\n- The H1 heading;\n- The opening sentence.\nYou can leave one or two of these out, but no more than two. If you do these things, you'll target the keyword better than most other websites.\nThe MozBar also shows this, again, for free:\n## So to recap\nThis tool lets you see:\n- The legitimacy of websites so you're less likely to be scammed or duped.\n- How authoritative search engines view your website ( some ways to improve it ).\n- How competitive a search term is.\n- How well you and competitors are targeting search terms.\nI use this several times a day, and after this article, maybe you will as well."

    "text": "This article shows how to do SEO for a newsletter, using my newsletter as an example.\nThe changes I made to my newsletter landing page SEO did not take long, and the results have been outstanding.\nWhat I'll share below are optimizations anybody can do.\n## Initial SEO data\nThis recent week was good for this website's SEO.\nSince mid-December, I've put more thought into the SEO for Edwardsturm.com.\nNow, a month later, I'm seeing results.\nThe SEO that I've done for https://edwardsturm.com/newsletter/ is a good example.\nOn December 20th, 2023, a feature came out about me in a major online publication.\nOne of the things written is:\n\"Growth hacking newsletter,\" it said - linking to my newsletter.\nSo I started wondering, do people search for this?\nThey do.\n0-10 isn't much. However, as I wrote in a previous article, keyword volume estimations are always low .\nThis is because if you rank #1 on Google for one keyword, you will also rank high for many variations, misspellings, and similar keywords.\nIn reality, ranking #1 for this keyword will make the page get 500-1,000 monthly clicks from Google by people looking for a growth hacking newsletter or digital marketing newsletter to subscribe to.\nA lot more than 0-10.\nAlso, this keyword has a low difficulty score and high intent. The people searching are likely to convert - and it's not too competitive - it won't take much effort on my part.\n## On-page SEO\nBefore December 26, the page had no mention of \"Growth hacking newsletter.\" It had \"growth hack\" in the heading, but nowhere else.\nI knew that to rank well for \"growth hacking newsletter\" it would be easiest to put this exact phrase in my:\n- Page title.\n- Meta description.\n- Somewhere on the page.\nI could put it in other places, too, but I felt this was the bare minimum.\nSo, I started with the page title. This is what you see when you hover over the page tab on a web browser.\nYou can see there I also put it in the meta description.\nFinally, I added it to the copy on the page:\nI needed an excuse to use the keyword in the copy, so I put in: \" Question: What exactly is this?\"\nThis made the keyword flow with the rest of the page's writing.\nAll these changes took 5 minutes. It took me longer to make this write-up than it took to make these changes to the page.\nThe results:\nThe next day, I showed up in position 15 on Google for \"growth hacking newsletter.\"\nThe week after, #5.\nOne week ago, #7.\nAnd this most recent week, #2.\nSomething to note here, by the way: often, it takes time to rank. Even after you put in the work, it may take weeks or months to show up in the top spots. Sometimes, it's instant, but this is unusual. Typically, expect some waiting time. Don't get discouraged if you have to wait.\n## Building links\nRanking #1 is more competitive.\nThe page I'm competing with is authoritative, has growth hackers in the URL, and has the direct keyword in the page title.\nAdditionally, the individual page has a bunch of backlinks.\nHowever - and there's a big however.\nThis is the page:\nThere's virtually no copy.\nSo, by sheer virtue of having a lot more copy, I believe I can beat it.\nI'll need more links, though.\nI've already successfully been using Featured.com to get links to my main website.\nBut I'll also need more links going to my newsletter page.\nThis will tell search engines that the newsletter is reputable.\nTwo mornings ago, I Googled \"newsletter directories\" and found a big list of directories to submit my newsletter to.\nAnd that's just what I did.\nI created a spreadsheet to track the language I use on each directory - this makes it easy in the future to change language and have it stay consistent across directories.\nThen, I submitted my newsletter and the URL to each directory.\nThe beauty here is you get to craft the language around your brand yourself.\nI did some keyword research and found that \"digital marketing newsletter\" will be a good keyword to go after in the future. So I made sure to put \"digital marketing\" into each directory along with \"growth hack.\"\nThis tells Google that Edwardsturm.com has a reputable growth hacking newsletter and digital marketing newsletter.\nAnd that's it.\nI suspect I'll have to do a few more weeks of waiting to get to #1 for \"growth hacking newsletter\"- though I'm already getting traffic and sign-ups from being #2.\nAnd I'm inspired by what else I can use this method for.\nThere are directories for everything.\nI can use this to get backlinks and relevant SEO language to every aspect of my brand.\nAnd you can with your brands, too.\nBut for starters, this is an easy and fast way to optimize your newsletter for search engines."

    "text": "Something everybody likes:\nSpending minimal time and effort and getting excellent results.\nOver the last two weeks I did this with my videos.\nI got 7 million views across TikTok and Instagram Reels, grew my following, increased email subs to my newsletter, and increased my recognition (because I deliberately put my face in everything).\n## What I did\nI got great subject matter from two sources.\nThe first was Google's conversational AI, Bard.\nPreviously, I made this high-performing TikTok (below) where I narrated the \"How To Start a Movement\" video from 13 years ago.\n> @build_in_public How to start a movement. #successstory #startuptips #marketingtips #entrepreneurship  A Day in My Life - Soft boy\nBard took the video I sent, searched YouTube for similar videos, and recommended them.\nA few minutes into the first recommended video, I heard a hilarious marketing fail from Fiji Water.\nI made this video about it.\n> @build_in_public We drink bottled water because of the marketing and convenience. But this is a hilarious story of how Fiji's marketing shed light on the fact that bottled water is, in many ways, worse than tap. #marketingfail #marketingstory #advertising #business101  MONACO - Bad Bunny\nIt went viral.\nI put it onto Instagram Reels with this trick .\nIt went viral again.\nGreat.\nBard's next recommended video - Steve Jobs talking about the Got Milk campaign.\nJust like the first one, I heard some excellent subject matter a few minutes into the video. I turned that into a TikTok . It went viral.\n> @build_in_public Looking at the \"Got Milk?\" campaign through the eyes of Steve Jobs. \"Got Milk doesn't even talk about the product. Matter of fact, it focuses on the absence of the product.\" -Jobs #copywriting #advertising #marketing #stevejobs  Cry by Cigarettes After ___ - Your Audio Girl\n## Conversational AI isn't my only source for great content\nI'm a fan of Shaan Puri's newsletter, Small Boy .\nEvery Tuesday, he shares the five most entertaining tweets he sees (usually about marketing and business) and a sentence or two of his commentary.\n## A trick for identifying high-performing subject matter\nHere's an easy way to identify high-performing subject matter.\nLook at the view count to follower ratio. If a piece of content has a lot of views compared to how many followers the person has, then it's viral subject matter.\nIn this case, Shaan shared:\n- One tweet with 3.5 million views for only 34,100 followers. - One tweet with 20.1 million views for 201,500 followers.\nRatios check out.\nI made videos on both.\nI spent 10 minutes on each of the two videos.\nThey both went viral on TikTok.\n> @build_in_public This guy's dentist is in Texas but his receptionist is in the Philippines. Is this the future of outsourcing? Will we see this more often over the coming years? Is this a good idea? A bad idea? What do you think? #outsourcing #smallbusinessowner #staffing #Entrepreneur  Vintage - Cort\nThey both went viral on Instagram .\nAnd they're some of my best-performing YouTube Shorts.\n## Content telephone\nBasically, what happened is:\nTwo posts on TwitterX went viral.\nShaan shared these posts in his newsletter with a few sentences of commentary.\nThis led to me sharing the same posts with a few sentences of my own commentary.\nPeople started resharing my videos and doing their own commentary on my videos.\nOr with Bard... I asked Bard to give me content similar to one video that did well.\nIt took more previously well-performing videos and gave those to me.\nI made videos about them. They performed well again.\nAll of this enforced my brand to millions of qualified viewers (marketing and business viewers).\n## What you can do\nPretty simple.\nFind the people sharing the best content in your niche.\nNewsletters, Instagram accounts, TikTok accounts, and TwitterX accounts are the places to look.\nWhen these accounts have something that gets way more views than typical for how many followers the account has, make content about it.\nOriginal content is excellent, too, but this is an effective trick for subject matter when you're not feeling the juice.\n## Even the most viral content hasn't been seen by everybody\nRemember, there are still people out there who haven't seen Gangnam Style.\nI've met tons of people who don't know who MrBeast is.\nT-Series is the most subscribed YouTube channel, with 256 million followers and 243 billion views. I hadn't heard of them or seen any of their videos until a few weeks ago.\nIt's a big world we live in.\nGet subject matter with an outsized ratio.\nShare it yourself.\nEnjoy the growth."

Maybe you're looking for upcoming games? Maybe you want mini-games for your channel (or a channel that you're about to create)?\nWhatever it is, this list should be able to help you.\n## A Note About Having Fun\nWhile picking a good game is important, the standard rule of thumb is to pick one that you want to play and that you can have fun with. If you're having fun, it's easy to do your best commentary and make your best videos. The legendary PewDiePie says it best, \" Keep having fun with it and don't try too hard .\"\nThis list has a lot of great titles, old and new. Pick the ones that you think you'll like most.\n## Animal Well\nNintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Microsoft Windows - Indie game, Platform game, Adventure game, Puzzle Video Game, Adventure\nAnimal Well is beautiful. I'm writing this only a few days after beating the main game myself, but there's still so much left to do. Why it's great for YouTube and streaming: fun to look at, sounds incredible, notoriously produced by one of the top videogame YouTubers, Videogamedunkey, and fast-paced. The game was made by one person, Billy Basso. He coded the game engine, made the art, the music, the characters, the sounds - everything! Something that sticks out is there is zero loading time when going from section to section. Aside from this, the puzzles are fun, there's a ridiculous amount of easter eggs, and the game is plain old artistry. Animal Well is an excellent addition to any YouTube gamer's uploads.\n## Baby Steps\nMicrosoft Windows, PlayStation 5 - Adventure\nWhen just the trailer goes viral, you know the game will be good for YouTube. Baby Steps comes from the minds of Getting Over It , a smash hit for gaming videos. In it, you play as somebody learning to walk in a strange environment. Literally learning to put one foot in front of the other without falling down. This game is bound to be frustrating, funny, goofy, and visually appealing - a perfect fit for your YouTube channel; and the soundtrack will make you giggle. It will be released sometime in 2024.\n## Baldur's Gate 3\nWindows, PlayStation 5, macOS, Xbox Series X/S - Role-playing\nBaldur's Gate 3 meets at the convergence of a popular, high-rated game with a game that has a lot of customizability, options, and paths. This makes it an ideal match for YouTube, as there are many ways to differentiate content. The campaign is lengthy and deep, and there are branching storylines. The combat is complex, and characters can be highly customized. The visuals are appealing. The soundtrack is fire. This is a game that people are obsessed with. It will attract views and give endless options for the videos you make.\n## League of Legends\nWindows, macOS - Multiplayer online battle arena\nLeague of Legends is still one of the most popular games in the world. Its massive tournaments get huge amounts of passionate fans, and the game always seems to have a ton of players online at once. The fun will come from the intense games you get into, great escapes, outplays, and general interactions with other players. If you haven't tried LoL yet, it's not too late.\n## Hollow Knight: Silksong\nWindows, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X/S - Metroidvania, Fighting, Adventure\nThe original Hollow Knight is one of the best Metroidvania games ever. With an enchanting and ominous setting, a beautiful melancholy OST, and outstanding gameplay (seriously, it's so fun), it's a very welcome indie studio breakout. The sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong , has been delayed for some time. However, 2024 is the year for its release. It's hyped up because the original was so good. Expect many playthroughs, speed runs, modding, OST-only videos, and fan art.\n## Pokemon Legends: Arceus\nNintendo Switch - Action role-playing This entry should really be about any game in the Pokemon franchise. I even had a no commentary playthrough (which is very popular now) of Pokemon FireRed on my external monitor as I wrote this. However, since Pokemon Legends: Arceus is the newest game in the series, and it is actually pretty \"legendary,\" it has to be included. We have been waiting forever for an open-world Pokemon game, and we finally got it. This game is great for YouTube because of its exploration, discovery, soundtrack, throwbacks, and Easter eggs.\n## Cocoon\nNintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and Series S, Microsoft Windows - Indie game, Puzzle Video Game, Adventure game, Adventure\nI first learned about Cocoon from Videogamedunkey's video on it (below) and immediately loved what I was seeing. Psychedelic visuals. An intense, ambient OST. Masterful geography and puzzles. You're literally figuring out worlds within worlds. The game designer was the lead gameplay designer for LIMBO and INSIDE , two hits for YouTube gamers. IGN called this a \"breathtaking puzzle-platformer.\" You'll have fun playing this. Your audience will have fun watching. And when you get frustrated figuring out the puzzles and excited at success, your audience will experience these emotions with you.\n## Elden Ring\nMicrosoft Windows, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One - Action role-playing\nFamously, Elon Musk's favorite game , Elden Ring is a Dark Souls type game set in a hyper-fantastical world. You play as a custom character on a quest to uncover the truth behind the mysterious Elden Ring and restore balance to the lands. The game features a combination of very hard battles, immersive storytelling, and stunning graphics, making it great to play and watch on YouTube. You also explore curiosity-provoking open worlds and interact with various characters to find secrets and solve puzzles.\n## Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\nNintendo Switch - Fighting\nThough it was released at the end of 2018 and all the DLC is out, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is far from old. It has every Super Smash Bros. fighter ever and tons more. Its online works very well. The range of characters and universes provides constant, interesting content. There remains an active competitive scene. There's just so much to do in this game, and the franchise is so popular, there's no doubt Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a solid choice to play and entertain with.\n## Roblox\nWindows, macOS, iOS, Android, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One - Game creation system, MMO\nRoblox is an awesomely popular game creation platform. Users design, share, and play games and virtual experiences. It's excellent for streaming because it has an active community, a constantly updated library of content, and the ability to go viral sharing your own games. Fans are passionate, and videos are abundant in comedy. Roblox gives a rich source of material, and its wide appeal to players of all ages and interests will help grow your subscribers.\n## Hogwarts Legacy\nWindows, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch - Action role-playing\nHogwarts Legacy has surprised many by how good it is. It's the most realistic Harry Potter game to date, and you can do things like fly around Hogwarts' premises on a broom, get into wand fights, and ride on fantastical creatures through the Forbidden Forest. Harry Potter , with its blockbuster books and movies, gives you an enormous global fanbase to leverage - so your videos can tap into an existing faucet of views. Finally, this game isn't only fun to watch, but fun to play. It's the ideal combination for a videogame to play on YouTube.\n## EA SPORTS FC 24FIFA 23\nPlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X and Series S, PlayStation 5, Android, Microsoft Windows - Sports\nEA Sports and FIFA ended their several decade-long partnership, which is why this game is not called FIFA . However, this is only a name change, and FIFA players will recognize this game as a continuation of the series. It has an enormous player base, hyper-realistic gameplay, and tons of features. Given soccer's global appeal, if you want to play a sports game, you can't go wrong with EA SPORTS FC 24 . Can't neglect to mention that opening packs can also make for some good times.\n## God of War Ragnarok\nPS5, PS4 - Action-adventure, hack and slash\nMany AAA videogames these days are buggy, slow, and disappointing. Not God of War Ragnarok. Many would call this an \"ideal\" game. The God of War series has been around for a long time now, but it has aged oh, so well. Its combat is still exciting, Norse mythology stories are still immersive, and visuals are still of the highest caliber. There are so many ways to enjoy this game or niche up your videos that if you have a Playstation, this is a great one to play.\n## Among Us\nPretty much every platform - Party, social deduction\nAmong Us is a super popular multiplayer game. Players do tasks and small puzzles while identifying and eliminating the \"imposters\" among them. You can also play as the imposter, giving you abilities to cause chaos and eliminate other players. Among Us is a favorite among YouTubers because it focuses so well on the single-core imposter mechanic, creating loads of speculation and tension. Everybody analyzes everything. Jokes are made. Memes are flowing. Oh, and you can even play it in VR.\n## Fortnite\nPretty much every platform - Survival, battle royal, sandbox\nThe games that are on all platforms usually have the largest amounts of players, which also makes them good games to play for YouTube. Fortnite is no exception - it has a ton of fans around the world. Not only do people have deep relationships with this game, but it's also fun to watch as it has vibrant and colorful graphics, fast-paced gameplay, tons of items and skins, and regular updates to keep it fresh.\n## Marvel's Spider-Man 2\nPS5 - Action-adventure\nSpider-Man can fly! Here's why this game is incredible for YouTube. First, Spider-Man can fly. It's an open world with the biggest NYC map anybody has made. I'm an NYC native, and this map impresses even me. The combat is varied and interesting. Did I mention Spider-Man can fly? The swinging around the city is incredible and pleasing to watch. You could have a channel where all you do is swing around the map, and people would watch that. The biggest characters from Spider-Man are in this. And finally, Spider-Man can fly.\n## Grand Theft Auto V\nPretty much every platform, except Nintendo - Third-person shooter, first-person shooter, action-adventure\nThough certainly not a new game, Grand Theft Auto V is still one of the most popular games to make videos of and this list would be remiss without it. GTA 5 's very fun physics, massive sandbox, and enthusiastic modding community have led to some very click-worthy thumbnails, very interesting Let's Play videos, and a maintained level of freshness that most games don't have.\n## Super Mario Maker 2\nNintendo Switch - Level editor, platform\nSuper Mario Maker 2 is an endless well of creativity. In it, you build custom 2D side-scrolling Mario levels and play other people's levels. You can play as a variety of characters, even playing as Link from The Legend of Zelda ! The game has a massive speedrunning community, but the fun and mayhem that comes from playing ridiculous levels alone are enough to entertain your viewers.\n## Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III\nXbox Series X and Series S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Microsoft Windows - First-person shooter\nThough certainly not the highest-rated game in the Call of Duty franchise, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III brings back the state-of-the-art gunplay that so many players know and love. This game's community is so large and passionate it's hard not to carve out a piece of the pie if you're making videos on it. Also, the game's attention to detail is hard to miss - the graphics and thoroughness of the development teams are appreciated. Enjoy the hyper-competitive nature of CoD , be loud, and have fun!\n## The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\nNintendo Switch - Action-adventure\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the highly anticipated follow-up to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild . Breath of the Wild was one of the most successful games of all time - and with reason. It's a brilliantly creative game with tons to do, see, and hear. YouTube videos on it of all types are extremely popular and legitimately fun to watch. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is no different. There's tons to do in the air, on the ground, and even underground! It's one of the best Nintendo games and it gives players endless creativity. There's so much content in this game and YouTubers will be making videos on it for years.\n## Palworld\nXbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S, Microsoft Windows - Role-playing Video Game, Shooter Video Game, Indie game, Fighting game, Strategy Video Game\nBefore its release, Palworld was completely unknown. One day after its release, it was the most-played game on Steam. This game is a combination of Pokemon , Fortnite , Minecraft , Breath of the Wild, Grand Theft Auto , and more. It combines some of the most popular games of all time into one game! There's a multiplayer mode, so you can stream and make videos with friends. There's a huge open world to explore. There's tons of variety- a ridiculous amount to do and many ways to do it. This game appeals to everybody of all ages and all demographics. Because the game is so huge, there will be content opportunities for years to come. This is an easy choice for a YouTube gamer.\n## Animal Crossing: New Horizons\nNintendo Switch - Adventure game, Social simulation game\nFor those who don't know, no-commentary YouTube channels about walking through cities actually make the creators behind them very healthy livings. This is because the watch times are high - people leave the videos on in the background - and there's a large market for this kind of chilled-out entertainment. The Animal Crossing series is the same. In fact, on my external monitor, right now, I have a no-commentary version of Animal Crossing: New Horizons just playing in the background. It helps me focus while also relaxing me. This is a beautiful game with incredible ASMR sound effects and a renowned OST. It has an active and zealous community behind it but is also great for casual gamers and casual watchers. Finally, it's a game of infinite customizability. It's expressive and creative, and you can make it uniquely yours in so many ways. Like all Animal Crossing games, Animal Crossing: New Horizons , is one the best titles on this list for YouTube gamers. Just make sure you label your video \"No Commentary\" if you're doing it for watchers to have on in the background.\n## NBA 2K24\nPlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Windows - Sports\nThere are so many updates to previous NBA 2K games that if you're a fan of basketball, you should get in on this. Incredible graphics as always, but improved hooping mechanics, new shot meters, more skill moves, a more realistic sprinting system, badges, and more make this a worthy addition to the franchise. NBA 2K players are some of the most fun to watch, which is why NBA 2K24 , the newest game in the series, has to be included on this list. If you love being loud and boisterous, this is for you.\n## Minecraft\nPretty much every platform - Adventure, sandbox, survival Saving the most popular for last. Minecraft helped to define gaming videos on YouTube and is still played by the top YouTube gamers every day. It has a rich history of being entertaining to watch and entertaining to play. It's highly customizable, highly explorable, packed with surprises, faultless for any age, and has a very good online so you can play with friends. It even has VR ! It's pretty much perfect for making gaming videos.\n## Agame.com\nWhat if you don't want to play titles that everybody else is playing? Mini-games are the perfect solution for giving your channel variety while staying fresh compared to other gaming channels. Agame is a solid place because it has a diverse wealth of mini-games that are updated frequently. Lots of creativity on this site.\n## Games You Frequently See Appearing on Reddit.com/r/gaming\nNeed even more variety? Check the front page of Reddit's Gaming subreddit for trending games. These are games that have elements that aren't only fun to play, but fun to watch . If they weren't fun to watch, they wouldn't be on this website. It's a good place to start if you're stuck.\n## Popular Reviews from IGN\nAnother good place to find ideas for games, if this list isn't enough for you, is IGN. By looking at popular reviews, you can find a solid list of games in demand. While all of these aren't inherently perfect for gaming videos, they have a trending relevance, which means people will be searching for them and will want to watch them.\n## Upcoming Games from IGN\nFinally, to know what games to play right when they're released, when they have the most amount of hype , use IGN's \"Upcoming Games.\" Play these games right when they come out, and you can be one of the first with a Let's Play video for a particular hyped-up game.\n## Sharing Content on Other Platforms\nWhat if you want your videos to appear on more than only YouTube? If you're not putting your videos onto other platforms, you're leaving viewers and subscribers on the table.\nHere are some of the platforms you can also share your gaming videos on:\n- TikTok\n- Instagram\n- Facebook\n- Twitter\n- Pinterest\nThe downside to trying to be everywhere at once is uploading to each platform takes a lot of time and energy. You have to upload the video and paste in the title, description, and tags. You may be better off spending this time and energy on content creation instead.\nI personally am a power user of Repurpose.io , which allows me to upload a video to one platform and have it automatically go to all the other platforms - along with my titles and tags. There aren't even any watermarks.\nFor example, here's what happens whenever my Build in Public brand puts a video out on TikTok:\nSomething like this is ideal for short gaming clips and occasionally longer videos. YouTube is definitely still a top place for being a gaming influencer, but these other platforms are worth paying attention to.\n## Conclusion\nThe games on this list are games that are sure to entertain you while also entertaining your audience. While some of the older games still make for great online content, there are lots of new titles constantly being released that are replacing the old. There's a huge variety in 2024, and it's looking like a good time to be a YouTube gamer.\nAnything you'd like to see added to this list? Any questions or feedback? Let me know what you think in the comments and if you liked this article, maybe consider sharing it with friends.\n## Bonus!\nThis list is pretty good too."

    "text": "One of the easiest growth hacks is finding \"low-hanging fruit.\"\nThese are wins that are so close you could reach up and take them like a juicy pear from a flowering tree.\n\nBut most people don't know how to find them.\nAnd even those who do, like me, often forget to look.\n## What I'm doing this week\nGoogle gives people with websites a tool for accessing their index.\nThis is another thing that most people with websites don't know.\nIt's called Google Search Console .\nYou can use it to submit your site to Google, see what you show up on Google for, see who's linking to you, and do tons of other useful things for getting more visibility from Google search.\nI'll cover the rest of those use cases in future articles. The one I'm concerned about this week is seeing what I show up on Google for.\nI:\n- Click \"Search results\" under \"Performance\" on the left sidebar.\n- Click \"Export\" in the top right.\n- Open my file up in my spreadsheet tool of choice.\n- Filter the top row so I can sort through it.\nHere's my rankings from the last 7 days, unfiltered.\nHere's the same rankings filtered by:\n- Top queries (keywords) do not contain \"game\" and \"gaming.\"\n- Position (ranking on Google) is less than 26.\nRight away, there are some interesting things that stick out.\nHere's one of them.\n\"Podcasts looking for guests.\"\nA search with Moz's Keyword Explorer , shows this query gets a good amount of traffic.\nAnd if you remember what I shared in a previous article, the actual clicks from ranking #1 for this keyword are more likely to be several thousand .\n> @build_in_public Explaining SEO while on a sunny walk through Poland. Most keyword volume estimates are heavily misleading. Ranking 1 for a keyword will give 10-200 times the projected search volume. #seo #searchengineoptimization #marketing #gotomarket  original sound - Build in Public\n## Making changes\nMy existing article, \" How to Get On Podcasts as a Guest ,\" is lengthy and relevant and would likely be a good fit for this keyword.\nIn the future, I may make a dedicated article called \"How to Find and Engage Podcasts Looking for Guests in 2024.\" But for now, I can spend five minutes and likely rank high on page 1 of Google for the keyword.\nThe change is simple.\nThe aforementioned existing article does not use the exact keyword \"podcasts looking for guests\" even once.\nI added the following sentence to the introduction, \"Initially, I thought about cold emailing different shows but quickly speculated there had to be tools for finding podcasts looking for guests. This hunch was right.\"\nAnd that's it! This will likely be enough to get me into a good position for the keyword.\nWill it be enough to get me to the first spot? It's possible, actually. The keyword isn't as competitive as it should be, given its high intent (people who are searching this already know what they want; it's at the bottom of the consumer funnel). Anyway, my small change will take a few weeks at least to show.\nHowever, I didn't think of this keyword myself as being valuable. I didn't know people were searching this.\nGoogle Search Console showed me my site is in position 10 for it. Moz showed me a decent amount of people search it.\nAnd as much as I explained this single low-hanging fruit keyword in this email, the download from Google Search Console showed me that there are hundreds more.\nSo often, we spend time on the hard stuff.\nThe new stuff.\nAnd forget that we have existing opportunities just waiting to be taken advantage of."

    "text": "I thought I had seen it all.\nUp until lunch on Monday.\nI was Googling to see what ranked for \"TwitterX Ads Glitch.\" I expected to show up, but wanted to see which content of mine ranked.\nIt was one of my podcast episodes about it.\nBut it wasn't on YouTube.\nAnd it wasn't on my site.\nIt was instead on a site called Eightify.\nNot only that, the bulk of the page was an AI-generated summary of my podcast episode.\nMy episode was only embedded .\nAnd, the content was 40% misleading and innacurate.\nRather than be angry that this site ranked with my content, I was instead curious.\nI did some digging.\n## This website did not exist\nOh, it was strange.\nEightify did not exist one year ago.\nIt was made at the very end of December, right after the release of ChatGPT.\nYet...\nSomehow...\nIt ranked on Google for over 200,000 keywords.\nI lost my appetite but finished my lunch.\nAnd took my computer to my desk.\nI put on my Berghain Techno playlist . It was time for a deep dive.\n## This is how Eightify got these results\nI want to stress, I have never seen anything like this in search engine optimization.\nI didn't even think ranking this fast for this many keywords was possible.\nBut it is.\nAnd I'm going to tell you how.\n- Eightify is a Chrome Extension that uses GPT to summarize videos.\n- When a user creates an AI-generated summary, a page gets created on the Eightify website with that summary.\n- GPT writes the Page Title, Meta Description, subtitle, and text.\n- GPT classifies and categorizes the summary and uses this to: Organize it on the site so every page is linked to from the footer. Recommend related summaries.\n- Organize it on the site so every page is linked to from the footer.\n- Recommend related summaries.\n- The website looks clean and nice. This helps retain visitors and gets them clicking through to related summaries.\n- Most importantly, the AI-generated text passes GPT writing detectors. Here's a screenshot from Zerogpt.com:\nThis means it's possible that Google's algorithms don't even recognize this as AI-generated text.\nAnd Eightify isn't even using a special AI. They're using GPT from OpenAI with specific settings that get it past AI writing detectors.\nTheir homepage even says, \"GPT-powered.\"\n## Press\nThere's one more important element.\nThat's Press.\nFrom my days doing SEO for enterprise companies: Microsoft, Time Inc. P&G, etc, I have access to a $15,000/month SEO tool.\nThis gives me incredible data.\nIt turns out Eightify didn't start ranking until September .\nHowever, when you see their press mentions, this makes sense:\nAnd this press push increased Eightify's SEO domain authority fast enough that Google started ranking its pages in September.\n## The Ouroboros\n\"The Ouroboros is an emblematic serpent of ancient Egypt and Greece represented with its tail in its mouth, continually devouring itself and being reborn from itself.\"\nBerghain Techno still blaring, there was one more thing to investigate.\nWhat happens when an LLM trains off AI-generated text?\nThe quick answer, it ruins the AI model.\nEventually, the AI will generate complete nonsense .\nAnd because Eightify's content ranks high on Google and passes AI writing detectors, there was a massive chance that both Bard and GPT train off it.\nA bit different from an Ouroboros, this snake doesn't get reborn.\nThis, I believe, put Eightify at risk of a considerable penalization.\nI sent this cold message to Eightify's founder:\nWithin 30-minutes, he put in the required code.\nSo, if you have a software product and you want to get SEO results like this using AI, make sure you block Bard and ChatGPT from your content - (unless you have human reviewers).\n## Now that this is possible...\nMy mind opened up.\nI truly did not think there was a way to rank mass amounts of AI-generated content.\nThe opportunities here are tremendous.\nI made a podcast about the biggest one.\nBottom-of-funnel SEO , the most powerful marketing channel there is, can be automated with thousands of pages created.\nThis means you can bring huge amounts of purchase-intent traffic to ANY BRAND.\nANY PRODUCT.\nANY SERVICE.\nANYTHING.\nI made this podcast on how it would be done.\nBut after recording that, I realized that whoever develops it should keep it for themselves. It would be that powerful of a tool.\nThis isn't all, of course.\nIf you have a piece of software with user-generated-content, you may be able to enhance each user generation with generations from AI.\nAnd if you follow what Eightify has done, you may be able to get a ton of extra traffic through this.\nRegardless of what you do, I think it's important to know this is even possible.\nI'll end this article by repeating the accomplishment.\nThis company did not exist one year ago.\nNow, it ranks on Google for over 200,000 keywords.\nBTW - If you made it this far, special reward. The TwitterX Ads Glitch HAS NOT BEEN PATCHED. And I just recorded a podcast on how to trigger it."

    "text": "As of today, the TwitterX Ads Glitch no longer seems to be working .\nBummer.\nI'm now getting normal results with the Glitch settings:\nIt felt too good to be true, and I'm glad I took advantage of it while it lasted.\nSo, this got me thinking...\nWhat other things feel too good to be true, which I don't know how long they'll be around for?\nTurns out there are plenty of them.\nSo, in this article, I will share my four favorite ones.\nFour favorite hacks that feel too good to be true, which I hope will be around for a lot longer, but like the TwitterX Ads Glitch, I could also see going away soon.\n## 1. Instagram resharing\nHere's how this one works.\nTake a well-performing video from another platform, preferably TikTok.\nUpload it to Reels only (not the profile grid).\nIt performs well again.\nAnd the trick...\nYou can do this over and over again with the same videos every couple of months.\nThat's right.\nInstagram does not seem to care if a video was uploaded before. If people resonate with it, the algorithm shows it to more people.\nHow do I know this?\nAll my TikToks come out to Instagram Reels with trick #2 (below) the moment they're uploaded to TikTok.\nSometimes, they don't go viral on Instagram Reels, but they do go viral on TikTok.\nIf I try uploading the video again to Instagram Reels several weeks or months later, these videos usually go viral.\nIt seems the Instagram algorithm does not monitor the video content to see if the same video has already been uploaded.\nThis effectively means one viral video is evergreen. It can go viral infinitely on Instagram Reels with this trick.\nTo do it:\n- Duplicate your Reel on your phone - so you have a freshly created version in your photos app.\n- Upload this to Instagram.\n- Save it as a draft.\n- Go into the draft through the Reels tab. You should be able to toggle off \"Also share to Feed.\"\n- If you don't have this, try uninstalling and reinstalling Instagram ( I had to do this ).\nIt feels too good to be true to make the same video go viral every couple of months.\n## 2. Video syndication with Repurpose\nWhenever I post a TikTok, it comes out simultaneously without the watermark to Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, Facebook Reels, TwitterX, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Google Drive.\nI use Repurpose.io for this. It's $20/month.\nI made a viral video about Repurpose on TikTok. It got 1.8 million views. I was sure that TikTok would block this tool after this.\nThat was February.\nIt still works.\nI reposted the video to Instagram Reels recently. It went viral again.\nThe tool still works.\nI save so much time with this automation. I'm so grateful for it.\nLike #1, it feels too good to be true, and I don't know how long it will last (but I hope forever).\n## 3. Featured.com\nI shared in last week's article that I suspect Featured will be an incredible place to get backlinks.\nBacklinks, if you don't know, increase SEO domain authority so you can show up #1 on Google for stuff. They're extremely important and you want the most authoritative websites and publications linking to your website.\nThe hunch that Featured would be good for this so far is proving true. I've been using it daily for the last week and have already gotten a high-authority link.\nI know this tool won't last long.\nHelp A Reporter Out (Featured's free competitor) is no longer very good and is now going pay-to-play.\nI bet many webmasters and marketers will sign up to Featured, making it more competitive.\nSo I'm loving it while it lasts.\n## 4. Grok\nTwitterX's AI, Grok, will literally generate any text.\nAny text , even if illegal or involving famous people.\nIt will write anything .\nWhy is this good for marketing?\nIt will answer questions about the illicit marketing topics that ChatGPT or Bard will not answer.\nFeatured isn't against any ToS, but I did get the tip for it from Grok - so it's already brought value.\nI don't know how much longer this will last, but I imagine TwitterX will put in limitations soon.\nAnother useful thing - Grok can be used with a VPN - whereas ChatGPT cannot. EU TwitterX users are blocked from Grok, but if they set a VPN to the United States, they can still use it. This too - I don't know how long it will last.\n## Bonus: Instagram Threads\nInstagram Threads opened in the EU this week .\nTo be honest, I don't know what marketing gems lie out there with Threads, but I know they exist and will be closed soon.\nThreads is:\n- Brand new.\n- Highly trafficked.\nThis means there will be oversights, loopholes, arbitrage opportunities, and more.\nIf you know of any, please reply to this. I always enjoy learning.\n## Try them\nThese four things have been so helpful for me and many others.\nI hope you'll give them a try...\nWhile they last."

If you're a visual person, I also have a Series on my TikTok (only on mobile) showing myself setting up these ads, saying what I'm running them to, and sharing conversions.\n## Grok is legit\nGrok was rolled out and is amazing, but not for its intended purpose.\nIt's awful as a ChatGPT or Bard competitor.\nFar too many hallucinations and factual errors.\nBut it shines at unearthing valuable posts in marketing and business.\nFor example, if you ask ChatGPT or Bard questions about black hat Instagram practices , it won't provide anything good.\nAnd forums around this are often too deluged with junk posts to be helpful.\nGrok , on the other hand, serves the freshest tweets and threads.\nTweets and threads that previously were hard to access with TwitterX's broken search functionality (if you've ever tried searching TwitterX for content, you know the search is awful).\n> @build_in_public Grok is a dramatic level-up in knowledge.

Backlinks make your website more authoritative in the eyes of Google. This authority allows you to show up #1 on Google for more searches.\nGrok showed me this tweet:\nThen I looked at my own usage of this tool with only the free tier :\nNot going to lie, I'm pretty excited.\nI'm going to pay the $99 for the next month and try it out.\nJust one backlink from an authoritative website is enough to dramatically increase search engine rankings.\nI'm curious to see if the tool is worth the recent hype."

It was a syndicated video Tweet.\nI made a TikTok.\nThat TikTok automatically came out to Twitter through my automation with Repurpose .\nThe TikTok's description had a lot of text in it.\nThis created a searchable asset.\nSomebody searched Twitter for words that were in the Tweet.\nThe Tweet came up.\nThe searcher engaged.\nWith my automations, my TikToks come out simultaneously to:\n- Instagram Reels\n- TwitterX\n- Facebook Reels\n- YouTube Shorts\n- Pinterest\n- LinkedIn\nSo, this small increase in effort (adding extra text to video descriptions) creates searchable assets on every major social media platform.\nGoogle, as well, since YouTube is directly tied in.\n## This doesn't just apply to videos\nAdding a bit of extra text applies to anything that can appear in a search engine or social network (because all social networks are also search engines).\nOne more quick example.\nOur company, Reverb, is not the best online voice recorder.\nBut I made sure to add extra descriptions to filenames and alt text for all images on our website.\nIf you search Google Images for \"online voice recorder,\" here's what you see:\nFun fact: Google Images is so dramatically less competitive than main Google that it doesn't require any major tricks to show up there. Just a bit of extra text.\n## Exactly what to do\nInstead of 3-word video descriptions, make 'em 3 sentences.\nAdd some descriptive text to filenames of images on your website or filenames of videos you upload to YouTube.\nAnd if you upload anything anywhere that you would like to be discoverable, make sure to add just a bit of extra text."

    "text": "Publishing this week's growth hacking article earlier than usual.\nDuring the Silicon Valley Bank Collapse in March, I went hard making 4-5 TikToks a day about it.\nThe minimum views for one of them was 50k despite my new audience only being a fraction of what it is now.\nDuring that weekend, when I was posting video after video, my followers grew a lot.\nIn an article a few months ago , I wrote:\n\" Spin your niche to meet what's trending in the news (you don't always have to do this, but if you can, videos do a lot better). \"\nThis doesn't just apply to videos, of course, but any type of content.\nAnd this is what I'm doing with this week's newsletter.\nThe news of Sam Altman being fired from ChatGPT parent company, OpenAI, is only 3 hours fresh.\nI've already made two TikToks about it, and a few minutes into their release, they're both doing far above average.\n> @build_in_public Sam Altman was just fired from OpenAI and this is the leading theory as to why. #samaltman #openai #chatgpt #microsoft  Artificial Intelligence - Melodality\n> @build_in_public The REAL reason Sam Altman was fired from OpenAI. #samaltman #openai #chatgpt #microsoft  original sound - Build in Public\nThis is a growth hack because content with trending news tends to do way way better than normal . And to those who say the hype doesn't last, those days during the Collapse were some of my highest-follower-growth days.\nI have data to back this up.\nAs many readers know, I chart my TikTok follower numbers every morning at 6 AM .\nThis is the growth during the Silicon Valley Bank Collapse:\nIf you're in tech or startups, this is trending news that you can incorporate into your content.\nAnd if you're not (and I know many of you are not), always be on the lookout for newsbreaks that everybody is talking about.\nYou'll get far more engagement than usual."

    "text": "Ya know what's cool?\nWhen you don't have to do outreach.\nWhen you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours getting journalists, and influencers, and hosts to take notice of you so you can expand your reach or get a few backlinks.\nWhen these people instead reach out to you .\nBelieve it or not, this is a very common problem.\nThere are lots of people who don't want to manually do outreach or spend money on staff to do outreach for them.\nIn fact, this is such a common problem that many tech companies have raised and made millions of dollars trying to solve it.\nAND this is such a competitive market, that plenty of these companies are free or at the very least inexpensive.\nSo in this article, I'm going to share three of these companies.\nI've used many many many over my career.\nThese three are among my favorites.\n## 1. HARO\nAnybody who's been doing SEO long enough knows this tool.\nHARO stands for Help A Reporter Out and it was one of the first of these publications <> source/guest tools.\nOver the years, I've used it to get myself and my brands into literally the biggest publications on the planet.\nI recently used it to get one of our startups into Healthline, immediately bringing the startup onto Page 1 of Google for one of our bottom-of-funnel keywords . This then immediately began bringing us users from Google.\nHere's what HARO looks like:\nMy two tricks for HARO:\n- Respond to a query or two a day for a month (it's only on weekdays).\n- Don't use AI to write (having human-written responses is an easy way to stand out and be valuable (journalists can usually tell what's written by AI)).\nOh - HARO is free too \n## 2. Featured.com\nI received this email a few weeks ago:\nI responded.\nIt was easy.\nI paid nothing for this.\nFeatured.com is the rebrand of Terkel , which worked very well for me.\nYou fill out a profile, then you get sent journalist queries based on the keywords in your profile. The best thing to do here is to put several keywords in \"Job Title\" for the topics you want to be known for. Separate the keywords by an \"&.\"\nFeatured.com even gives you this \"Keyword Matching\" preference for emails. This way, you get notified when there's a journalist query in your exact niche.\nUnlike HARO, which is completely free for unlimited use, Featured.com is freemium . It's free for up to 3 responses a month.\n## 3. PodMatch\nI've used this to go on a ton of podcasts and get links from them.\nPodMatch uses AI based on the contents of your profile to match you with hosts who'd be interested in what you have to say.\nYou get three matches a day.\nEither hosts reach out to you (happens to me often), or you message your matches on PodMatch. Because PodMatch picks matches for you - you have a high conversion rate.\nPodMatch is the only one on this list that has no free tier. For a freemium alternative, you can use MatchMaker.fm , which is about 25% as effective as PodMatch.\nFor more, I wrote a full guide on how I get on podcasts as a guest .\n## Recap\nSo, to recap.\nHARO is GOAT. It's been so effective for me over the years in getting press and backlinks.\nFeatured.com is easy. It takes a few minutes to make a profile and then you get notified when a journalist in your lane needs a quote.\nPodMatch is GOAT for podcasts - which also is an effective way of getting backlinks."

This only works with Reels. Toggle off \"Also share to feed.\" The way to get this is to save as a draft, then go back into the draft through the Reels tab on mobile. This has the added benefit of making it so few, if any, of your existing followers will see the Reel (so you can keep recycling content, and nobody will know).\n- This has the added benefit of making it so few, if any, of your existing followers will see the Reel (so you can keep recycling content, and nobody will know).\n- Posted.\n## The results\nFirst day: Reel hit 27,000 views.\nSecond day: Reel hit 150,000 views.\nThird day: Reel hit 500,000 views and more than doubled my followers.\nFourth day: Reel hit 1,000,000 views and 3xs my original followers. Tons of people reaching out to me. Tons of people joining my newsletter.\nOn the fourth day, I also tried another piece of high-performing content from TikTok - my first viral TikTok, from back in January.\nFirst day: 27,000 views, just like the Reel before.\nSecond day: 150,000 views.\nThird day (today): It's the afternoon when I write this, and the Reel is up to 310,000 views.\nPretty incredible.\nMost people think a video or image goes viral only once.\nNah.\nViral content is now evergreen.\nEvery couple of days, I will repost one high-performing TikTok to Instagram. And I'll keep reposting the same pieces repeatedly with just a few months in between.\nAnd within those few months, I'll generate even more pieces of viral content.\nAnd because I'm not posting to my Instagram feed, my new followers won't get tired of the duplicate content - they won't see it!\nIt will only be in the Discover section - for the people who don't already know my brand.\nWhat is a growth hack?\n- Something that's fast.\n- Something that's easy.\nThis checks off both.\nSo, if you have a piece of well-performing content - keep reposting it FOREVER. And keep growing."

    "text": "Some of you may not have found this article through TikTok.\nI have a TikTok. It's growing at a healthy pace. The videos are decent. I make videos exclusively about growth hacking for startups.\nBut it didn't always used to be this way.\nThe videos used to suck.\nAnd the content used to be all over the place.\nAnd I used to have no followers.\nIn fact, 362 days ago, on Nov 1, 2022, when I opened the account, I had zero followers.\nSince then, I've managed to put out at least one video a day.\nI've never missed a day.\nEven when I had the norovirus during a weekend trip to Barcelona I still managed to get out one lazy video:\n> @build_in_public The two year rule in startups is a relentless law that everybody breaks. #buildinpublic #startup #indiehackers #learnfromme  Cornfiield Chase- - \nI've also charted my growth without missing a day.\nEvery morning at 6 AM, I write in a spreadsheet how many followers I have. To the number:\nAnd this has given me insights that other creators who don't chart growth don't have.\nIf I take these numbers and turn them into a line chart, I can pinpoint each lesson that led to each spike in growth.\nSo, that's what I'll be sharing in this article.\nA few days ago, I recorded a 25-minute podcast about every single iteration I made to my content. You can listen to that here .\nBut this article will only cover the most impactful ones.\nThe 20% of iterations that lead to the 80% of growth.\nLet's start.\n## Iteration one: Hooks\nA good hook with average content goes viral. An average hook with good content flops.\nI made this video :\n> @build_in_public The founder of Nest is releasing a smart trashcan that automatically mails your scraps to chickens. #technews #startup #newtech  Colorvision - Com Truise\nThe editing was sloppy.\nThe subject matter was meh.\nBut the hook. The hook was a work of art.\nAnd I wasn't even thinking of making a good hook - I copied the headline for a TechCrunch article about the product!\nBut a friend told me the hook was great.\nAnd when the video took off...\nI realized how important hooks are.\nI hadn't put thought into them prior.\nThe growth that followed was me making several videos with good hooks.\nHooks are key. Here are some of my recent successful hooks .\n## Iteration two: Capitalize off trending events\nA simple lesson that I had been ignoring up until this point.\nIf something is trending in your niche and you cover it, it's easy views.\nDuring the Silicon Valley Bank Collapse, I put out 4-5 videos a day on the subject. I did this for three days. All of the videos got at least tens of thousands of views.\nOne of the videos got many millions and became the most viewed video in the world on the collapse .\nAfter this, I became more mindful about spinning my niche in the direction of trending topics for easy views.\n## Iteration three: I automated my editing workflow\nLessons three and four came quickly, one after the other.\nBut the first was that I stopped editing within the TikTok app.\nEditing in the TikTok app is easy. It's quick. It's perfect for getting started and building momentum.\nBut there were things I was doing, such as removing gaps between words, and making videos in multiple cuts - that I wanted to remove from my workflow.\nI tried a new tool.\nDescript .\nIt transcribes video and audio. You edit in the transcript like a Word doc rather than in the timeline.\nIt also automatically removes all the gaps between words. I no longer had to make these cuts myself. Everything was automatic.\nIt has a green screen effect.\nAnd you can add images and videos.\nThis made it so I could shoot my videos in one clip rather than multiple clips and have Descript's AI remove the more tedious parts of editing.\nMy speaking became more authentic because I didn't need to think about starting and stopping the camera, repositioning it, etc.\nAnd the level of sophistication I could put into my videos increased without an increase in time.\n## Iteration four: Focused more on giving value to viewers\nAfter posting for so long, I got a sense of who resonated with my content and what they wanted.\nRather than tech news and platitudes, I started focusing exclusively on founder stories , hacks , and new marketing discoveries I was making.\nFounder stories:\n> @build_in_public This 21 year old is making a fortune selling Notion templates. # #buildinpublic # #indiehackers # #entrepreneurjourney # #entrepreneurship101  Lofi Vibes - Gentle State\nHacks:\n> @build_in_public How to get more views on Instagram Reels. #instagramtips #socialmediahacks #techtips #buildinpublic  Mood Music - Evil Needle\nNew marketing discoveries:\n> @build_in_public  Please note: I don't condone or encourage this! #blackhat #entrepreneurship #marketinghacks #growthhack  som original - Maiko\nGiving direct value.\nI believe this improvement and solidified direction in subject matter - coupled with my improved editing capabilities - created the spike in growth you see in position four.\nSometimes, I would combine this new direction with trending news.\nI discovered a glitch with TwitterX ads that allowed me to get millions of impressions and thousands of link clicks for a dollar-per-day ad spend :\n> @build_in_public I shouldn't be sharing what's going on with Twitter. #twitterx #mediabuyer #elonmusk #mediabuying  Close Eyes - Slowed + Reverb - DVRST\nMy audience loved this, and not only did it go viral, but other people started talking about this as well.\nIt became trending news.\nSo, I made many videos offering value about this glitch and what I was doing with it.\nBecause this was trending, each one of these videos performed way above average.\nI shared it on my podcast . I even made a TikTok Series Tutorial about it.\n## Stringing together incremental advances\nI'll end this article with this quote from Michael Bloomberg.\nLife, I've found, works the following way:\nDaily, you're presented with many small and surprising opportunities.\nSometimes you seize one that takes you to the top.\nMost, though, if valuable at all, take you only a little way.\nTo succeed, you must string together many small incremental advances rather than count on hitting the lottery jackpot once.\nTrusting to great luck is a strategy not likely to work for most people.\nAs a practical matter, constantly:\n-Enhance your skills; -Put in as many hours as possible and; -Make tactical plans for the next few steps.\nThen, based on what actually occurs, look one more move ahead and adjust the plan.\nTake lots of chances, and make lots of individual, spur-of-the-moment decisions.\nDon't devise a Five-Year Plan or a Great Leap Forward.\nCentral planning didn't work for Stalin or Mao, and it won't work for an entrepreneur either.\nThanks so much for reading.\nHere's 100% of the iterations made along this one-year journey .
