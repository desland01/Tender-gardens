### üö´ BROAD KEYWORDS - DO NOT ACTIVELY PURSUE (Context Only)

**Why they're listed**: These terms show "topical authority" to Google (you ARE in the landscaping space), which can help niche rankings. However, **DO NOT create content or optimize for these terms** - they attract wrong customers (HOAs, conventional lawn care seekers).

| Keyword | Volume | Why NOT to Target |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| landscaping near me | 185,000+ | Too broad, attracts HOAs, commercial, conventional landscaping |
| lawn care near me | 105,000 | Lawn maintenance customers, not native garden focus |
| landscaping services [city] | 60,000+ | Generic, wrong customer type |
| lawn maintenance near me | 92,100 | Conventional turf grass maintenance, not your service |

**Strategy**: Let these happen naturally through directory listings (NAP consistency), but don't optimize pages for them.

## 6. ADVANCED SEO STRATEGIES BASED ON FINDINGS

- Partner with wildlife tracking apps (iNaturalist, eBird)

- Rank for informational keywords, convert to design consults

### Strategy #4: Hyperlocal Service Area Pages

**Tactic**:

- Create VERY specific location pages
- Example: "Native Garden Maintenance in [Specific Neighborhood]"
- Include neighborhood-specific plant recommendations, local wildlife

### Strategy #5: "Plant of the Month" Authority Building

**Insight**: Establish ongoing content authority
**Tactic**:

- Monthly deep-dive on one native plant
- Document its use in client gardens (with permission)
