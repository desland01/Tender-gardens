## 0) How Agents Must Use This Guide

### Blocking Prerequisites
* Treat this as a **blocking prerequisite**: no copy, pages, or templates are produced unless they align with this guide.
* Cite the section(s) used in your draft PR/response (e.g., "Aligned with §2 Scenario Pages and §4 Internal Linking").
* **Scope constraint:** This guide is **broad guidance** only. Do **not** create or imply offers, discounts, deadlines, or sales promotions. Avoid urgency language. Keep claims modest and verifiable.
* Refuse work if the request would violate the rules (e.g., stock photos, city-stuffing slugs, generic blog topics, promotional offers not approved).

### Agent Responsibilities
* **Before drafting any content:** Read this entire guide
* **During content creation:** Reference relevant sections
* **Before submitting work:** Self-audit against acceptance criteria (§10)
* **In PR descriptions:** Cite which sections you followed

## 1) Strategy at a Glance

### Foundation First
1. **Tidy the Google Business Profile (GBP) first.** Use real photos, complete categories/services/hours, post occasional updates, and invite recent customers for a few honest reviews (aim for 10+, pace naturally).

### Content Pillars
2. **Create high-intent scenario pages** (e.g., "same-day X", "affordable Y", "top-rated Z") that answer ready-to-hire searches with concise, specific info and a clear way to contact you.
3. **Write neighborhood-native posts** (what's actually happening in your service area) and link them back to relevant services.

### Technical Excellence
4. **Keep internal links deliberate:** Home → Services → Scenarios/Posts → Services. Put NAP (Name, Address, Phone) in the footer and link a small set of helpful resources.
5. **Mind the technical basics:** unique titles/descriptions/H1s, correct canonicals, minimal redirects, sitemap/robots, fast real images.
6. **Add lightweight JSON-LD:** LocalBusiness, Service, Breadcrumb, and FAQ when useful.

## 2) Information Architecture (Astro-Friendly)

### Content Collections (in `src/content.config.ts`)

#### Existing Collections
* **services**: `title`, `slug`, `blurb`, `highlight`, `featuredImage`, `duration`, `order`, `serviceAreas` (references locations)
* **locations**: `city`, `slug`, `county`, `blurb`, `heroImage`, `serviceHighlights`
* **reviews**: `name`, `rating` (1-5), `body`, `service` (reference), `published` (date)

#### Recommended New Collections

**scenarios** (for high-intent landing pages):
```typescript
scenarios: defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ pattern: '**/*.md', base: './src/content/scenarios' }),
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    headline: z.string(),
    modifier: z.enum(['same-day', 'affordable', 'top-rated', 'emergency', 'seasonal']),
    service: reference('services'),
    location: reference('locations').optional(),
    usp: z.array(z.string()),
    process: z.array(z.string()),
    cta: z.string(),
    proof: z.object({
      reviews: z.number(),
      rating: z.number(),
    }).optional(),
    gallery: z.array(z.string()),
    slug: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    faqs: z.array(z.object({
      q: z.string(),
      a: z.string(),
    })).optional(),
  }),
}),
```

**posts** (for neighborhood-native blog content):
```typescript
posts: defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ pattern: '**/*.md', base: './src/content/posts' }),
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    summary: z.string(),
    city: z.string(),
    neighborhood: z.string().optional(),
    published: z.date(),
    heroImage: z.string(),
    relatedServices: z.array(reference('services')),
  }),
}),
```

```

## 5) Neighborhood-Native Blog

### Purpose
Write posts that sound like a local professional sharing practical notes: neighborhoods, seasons, materials that perform well, recent weather, or local ordinances. Avoid generic listicles.

### Content Guidelines

**Topics to Cover**:
* Seasonal care tips specific to Florida/Orlando climate
* Neighborhood spotlights (e.g., "Best native plants for College Park gardens")
* Local regulations (e.g., "Orlando water restrictions for summer 2025")
* Recent weather impacts (e.g., "Post-hurricane garden recovery checklist")
* Material recommendations (e.g., "Mulch types that work in Central Florida heat")

**Topics to Avoid**:
* Generic "Top 10" listicles that could apply anywhere
* Overly promotional content
* Content with no local tie-in
* Doorway pages (thin content targeting keywords)

### Structure

* **Title**: Descriptive, includes location/neighborhood when relevant
* **Summary**: 1-2 sentence teaser (shown in blog index)
* **Hero Image**: Real photo from Orlando/local area (no stock)
* **Body**: 400-800 words, conversational tone
* **Internal Links**: Link to 1-2 related service pages
* **CTA**: Simple, contextual call-to-action at end

### Example Blog Post Frontmatter

```markdown
---
title: "Preparing Your Winter Park Garden for Florida Summer Heat"
summary: "Practical tips for keeping your Winter Park garden thriving through Orlando's intense summer months."
city: "Orlando"
neighborhood: "Winter Park"
published: 2025-05-15
heroImage: "/images/blog/winter-park-garden-summer.jpg"
relatedServices:
  - "lawn-maintenance"
  - "irrigation-systems"
---

Content here focuses on local conditions, neighborhood-specific challenges, and practical advice...

[End with contextual CTA linking to lawn-maintenance service]
```

### Internal Linking Strategy

Each post should:
* Link to 1-2 relevant service pages naturally in the body
* Optionally link to 1 related scenario page if highly relevant
* Include breadcrumbs: Home > Blog > [This Post]

---

## 6) Internal Linking Rules

### The Loop Pattern

**Home → Services → Scenarios/Posts → Services**

This creates a virtuous cycle where:
1. Homepage links to Services hub
2. Services hub links to individual service pages
3. Service pages link to scenario pages and blog posts
4. Scenario pages and blog posts link back to service pages

### Specific Rules

#### Global Navigation
* **Logo**: Always links to homepage
* **Main Nav**: Home, Services, Service Areas, Reviews, Blog, Contact
* **Footer**: NAP (Name, Address, Phone) + 3-6 key resource links

#### Homepage
* Link to `/services/` hub
* Feature 3-4 top services with links to detail pages
* Link to `/service-areas/` or top 3 location pages
* Link to `/reviews` or `/blog` (latest posts)

#### Service Pages
* Link to 2-3 related scenario pages (contextual, in-body)
* Link to 1-2 related blog posts (sidebar or end of page)
* Breadcrumbs to Services hub and Homepage

#### Scenario Pages
* Always link back to parent service page
* Link to 1-2 related local blog posts
* Breadcrumbs to Service page, Services hub, Homepage

#### Blog Posts
* Link to 1-2 related service pages (natural, in-body)
* Optional: Link to 1 scenario page if highly relevant
* Breadcrumbs to Blog index and Homepage

### Anchor Text Guidelines

* Use **natural, descriptive anchor text** (not repetitive exact-match keywords)
* Good: "our lawn maintenance services" → `/services/lawn-maintenance`
* Bad: "lawn maintenance lawn maintenance lawn maintenance" (keyword stuffing)
* Vary anchor text for the same destination across different pages

### Avoid

* Repetitive exact-match anchor text
* Linking the same text to different pages
* Excessive internal links (>5 per 500 words)
* Irrelevant cross-links just for SEO

---

## 7) Technical SEO Checklist

### Meta Tags (Every Page)

* **Title tag**: Unique, descriptive, 55-60 chars, includes location when relevant
* **Meta description**: Unique, compelling, 150-160 chars, includes CTA
* **H1**: One per page, matches page intent
* **Canonical**: Self-referencing unless there's a specific reason for cross-page canonical

### URL Structure

* Clean, descriptive slugs (e.g., `/services/lawn-maintenance`, `/scenarios/same-day-lawn-care-orlando`)
* No unnecessary parameters or IDs
* Lowercase, hyphens to separate words
* Location in URL when it helps (scenarios, service areas)

### Redirects

* No redirect chains (A → B → C)
* Use 301 for permanent redirects
* Use 302 for temporary redirects only
* Monitor redirect health in GSC

### Sitemap & Robots

* **sitemap.xml**: Include all services, scenarios, service areas, blog posts
* **robots.txt**: Links to sitemap, no disallow rules for public pages
* Submit sitemap to Google Search Console

### Images

* **Format**: WebP or AVIF when possible, fallback to optimized JPG
* **Size**: Aim for <300KB per image, <100KB for thumbnails
* **Attributes**: Include width/height, alt text, lazy-load
* **Real photos only**: No stock images, no AI-generated composites

### Performance

* Aim for Core Web Vitals green scores:
  - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) <2.5s
  - FID (First Input Delay) <100ms
  - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) <0.1
* Use Astro's built-in optimizations (static generation, component islands)
* Minimize JavaScript (use server-rendered components by default)

### Crawl Health

* No broken internal links (run regular audits)
* No duplicate titles or meta descriptions
* Proper use of heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
* Valid HTML (no unclosed tags, proper nesting)

---
import StructuredData from '@/components/StructuredData.astro';

const serviceSchema = {

Summer in Winter Park means 95°F days, afternoon thunderstorms, and intense UV that can stress even native Florida plants. Here's how to keep your garden thriving through the heat.

## Mulch Before the Heat Peaks

Late May is the perfect time to refresh your mulch layer. A 3-inch layer of pine bark or cypress mulch keeps soil cool and retains moisture during our dry spells. I've seen Winter Park gardens cut their water needs by 30% with proper mulching alone.

## Adjust Mowing Height

Raise your mower blade to 4 inches for St. Augustine grass. Taller grass develops deeper roots and shades soil, reducing heat stress. This is especially important for lawns along Park Avenue where afternoon sun is relentless.

## Water Deeply, Less Often

Orlando's summer water restrictions (2x per week) actually align well with best practices. Water deeply in early morning (4-8am) so grass develops strong roots. Shallow daily watering creates weak, heat-vulnerable lawns.

## Watch for Chinch Bugs

Winter Park's St. Augustine lawns are prime targets for chinch bugs in summer heat. Yellow patches that spread despite watering? Check the thatch layer for tiny black bugs with white wings. Catch them early and treatment is simple.

## Native Plants for Summer Success

Consider coontie, muhly grass, and firebush for beds that handle our summer extremes. These Winter Park natives laugh at 95°F and look better than heat-stressed annuals.

Need help preparing your lawn for summer? Our [lawn maintenance service](/services/lawn-maintenance) includes proper mowing height, edging, and cleanup—setting you up for a healthier summer lawn.

## Appendix: Keyword Research & Targeting

### Local Service Keywords (Orlando Focus)

**Primary Intent**: Ready to hire

* `[service] [city]` - e.g., "lawn maintenance Orlando"
* `[modifier] [service] [city]` - e.g., "same-day lawn care Orlando"
* `[service] near me`
* `[service] in [neighborhood]` - e.g., "landscaping in Winter Park"

**Secondary Intent**: Researching options

* `best [service] [city]`
* `top-rated [service] [city]`
* `affordable [service] [city]`
* `[service] cost [city]`

**Long-Tail Intent**: Specific problems

* `[problem] [city]` - e.g., "brown lawn patches Orlando"
* `how to fix [problem] [city]`
* `[seasonal task] [city]` - e.g., "prepare garden for Florida summer"

### Content-to-Keyword Mapping

| Content Type | Target Keywords | Example |
|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| Service page | Primary service + location | "lawn maintenance Orlando" |
| Scenario page | Modifier + service + location | "same-day lawn care Orlando" |
| Location page | Service + neighborhood | "landscaping Winter Park" |
| Blog post | Long-tail + neighborhood | "prepare Winter Park garden for summer" |

### Keyword Density Guidelines

* **Target keyword**: Mention 2-4 times naturally in ~500 words
* **Variations**: Use synonyms and related terms
* **Location**: Include in title, H1, first 100 words, and naturally throughout
* **Don't**: Stuff keywords or repeat unnaturally
