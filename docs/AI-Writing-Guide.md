# AI Writing Guide (Hormozi Playbook)

This guide distills Alex Hormozi's marketing teachings into a practical process for every agent who writes copy for Tender Gardens. **Read and follow this document _before_ drafting or revising any marketing content.** It works alongside the required pre-reads and must be applied after verifying higher-priority sources.

### Source-of-Truth Order (Review in this sequence every time)
1. `docs/business-info.json` — definitive facts about the business, owner (Jaime Goulet), services, differentiators, and service areas.
2. `docs/local-seo-strategy.md` — current campaign focus, priority keywords, and geographic targets.
3. `docs/seo-verification-dataforall.md` — validated keyword volumes, SERP gaps, and competitive positioning.
4. `docs/AI-Writing-Guide.md` — tone, structure, and offer framing guidelines (this file).

If any conflicts arise, defer to the higher-ranked document and flag the discrepancy in `docs/PROJECT-LOG.md` before publishing.

Use `docs/seo-audit-venice-2025.md` for deeper background once the four core sources are aligned and conflict-free. Review all resources together so your copy supports our native-plant mission, Venice-area SEO objectives, and UX standards.

## 1. Core Hormozi Frameworks To Anchor Every Draft

### Value Equation

> **Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) ÷ (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)**

- **Dream Outcome:** Paint the clearest picture of the transformation we deliver (lush, low-maintenance gardens that boost curb appeal and bookings).
- **Perceived Likelihood:** Use proof (case studies, testimonials, social proof, specific numbers) so readers trust the promise.
- **Time Delay:** Highlight fast wins, setup help, and timelines.
- **Effort & Sacrifice:** Remove friction by stressing white-glove service, done-for-you maintenance, and concierge support.

Every paragraph should either increase the numerator or shrink the denominator. If a sentence does neither, cut or rewrite it.

### Grand Slam Offers & $100M Offers Principles

1. **Define the dream outcome** for the exact audience segment.
2. **List every obstacle** stopping them from hiring us (budget, time, design overwhelm, compliance).
3. **Stack solutions** that remove those obstacles (financing, seasonal upkeep, HOA paperwork support).
4. **Trim low-value components** so the final bundle feels premium but focused.
5. **Price on value, not cost:** Frame price against the 10× value (increased bookings, venue buzz, higher property value).
6. **Risk reversal:** Pair guarantees (design revisions, satisfaction checks) with clear next steps.
7. **Urgency + scarcity:** Time-bound bonuses, limited install windows, or seasonal discounts.

### $100M Leads Guidance

- **Give > Ask:** Maintain a 4:1 ratio of value posts to promotional asks. Every “give” should teach, show, or inspire.
- **Omnipresent content:** Repurpose core ideas across site pages, blog posts, email flows, and social snippets with channel-specific hooks.
- **Lead magnets:** Offer high-value downloads (e.g., “Venice Venue Garden Stylebook”) tied to our SEO priorities. Make opt-ins effortless.
- **Paid + organic flywheel:** Write copy that warms cold traffic with story-driven proof, then retarget with direct offers.

### Content Hooks & Delivery

- **Hook – Retain – Reward:** Start with an outcome-focused hook, keep attention by stacking curiosity (“Here’s how we cut install time by 40%”), and reward with concise takeaways or next steps.
- **Promise & Pain:** Show the upside of acting _now_ and the cost of waiting (lost bookings, wilted displays, negative reviews).
- **Specificity:** Replace generic claims with measurable results (“32% more elopement bookings after our courtyard refresh”).

## 2. Voice & Tone Checklist

- **Embodied persona:** Write in Jaime Goulet’s voice—a Venice-based, friendly female founder with soil under her nails. Use first-person plural (“we”) for the crew and first-person singular (“I”) sparingly when Jaime shares personal stories or field lessons.

- **Plain-language confidence:** Short sentences, strong verbs, zero fluff. Favor concrete nouns over abstractions.
- **Authoritative warmth:** Blend expertise with neighborly care—sound like the gardener next door who happens to know native plants inside and out.
- **Evidence-rich storytelling:** Use mini case studies, before/after snapshots, or quantified anecdotes for credibility.
- **Authenticity beats hype:** Root examples in real projects, local neighborhoods, and seasonal rhythms Venice clients recognize.
- **Urgency that feels earned:** Tie deadlines to seasonal planting windows, vendor availability, or event calendars.
- **Clear calls-to-action:** Tell readers exactly how to take the next step and what happens afterward.

Before publishing, read the copy aloud. If any sentence feels awkward, jargon-heavy, or unbelievable, rewrite it.

## 3. Workflow For Writing Copy

1. **Re-read the mandatory resources** (`docs/local-seo-strategy.md`, `docs/seo-audit-venice-2025.md`, and this guide) to refresh positioning, keyword targets, and offer structure.
2. **Define the audience segment** (e.g., boutique hotels, wedding venues, homeowners associations) and their dream outcome.
3. **List pains and desired gains** using Hormozi’s promise/pain lens.
4. **Map proof assets** (photos, testimonials, stats) that increase perceived likelihood.
5. **Draft messaging hierarchy:**
   - Headline rooted in the dream outcome + specificity.
   - Subheadline reducing time delay or effort.
   - Body copy organized by Value Equation levers.
6. **Layer $100M Offers elements:** bonuses, guarantees, urgency cues, and next-step clarity.
7. **Run a friction check:** Ensure copy answers “Why now?”, “Why Tender Gardens?”, and “How risky is this?”
8. **Final pass:** Apply the Voice & Tone Checklist, verify SEO keywords from `docs/local-seo-strategy.md`, and confirm CTAs align with lead funnels in `docs/seo-audit-venice-2025.md`.

## 4. Quick Reference Templates

- **Outcome Headline:** “Transform `[venue type]` into `[specific benefit]` in `[time frame]` without `[major pain].`”
- **Proof Block:** “`[Client]` booked `[result metric]` more events after `[specific action we handled]`.”
- **CTA:** “Schedule a 20-minute design consult” + microcopy on what happens next.
- **Risk Reversal:** “If you’re not thrilled after the first bloom cycle, we’ll replant at no additional cost.”

Adapt templates—never copy-paste. Tailor every element to the audience and the offer bundle you created.

## 5. Final Sign-Off Questions

- Does every section amplify the Value Equation in our favor?
- Is the dream outcome crystal clear and audience-specific?
- Would a skeptical venue manager find the claims believable?
- Have we removed unnecessary effort and highlighted speed?
- Is there a compelling reason to act before the next season?
- Did we integrate SEO focus keywords naturally?
- Does it sound like Jaime—our Venice-based native gardener—speaking directly to neighbors and venue partners?

If any answer is “no,” revise before sharing or publishing.

**Mandate:** No copy goes live until this guide _and_ the two supporting docs have been reviewed for the current task. Document any deviations or open questions in `docs/PROJECT-LOG.md` so the next agent stays in sync.
