## Executive Summary

**Primary goal:** Rank on page one within six months for high-intent native garden maintenance and butterfly garden keywords tied to the Venice–Sarasota coast, generating enough qualified leads to support 8–10 recurring accounts plus 1–2 small installs per month.

## Target Keyword Strategy

Keyword volumes and difficulty scores are confirmed in `docs/seo-verification-dataforall.md`. Focus on phrases that match Jaime’s offer and service geography.

### Primary High-Intent Keywords (Top Targets)
1. **“native garden maintenance Venice FL”** / **“native garden maintenance Sarasota”**  
   - Search intent: Homeowners seeking ongoing care for existing native gardens  
   - Competition: Zero direct providers in SERPs (highest priority)  
   - Landing page: Core services page + Venice and Sarasota service-area pages

2. **“butterfly garden installation Sarasota”** / **“butterfly garden installation Venice”**  
   - Search intent: Homeowners commissioning small butterfly habitats  
   - Competition: Educational sites and tourist attractions only  
   - Landing page: Butterfly Garden Installation service page

3. **“native plant maintenance service Venice”** / **“native plant maintenance service Sarasota”**  
   - Search intent: Homeowners searching for ongoing care from a native plant specialist rather than a general landscaper  
   - Competition: Sparse; most SERP results are nursery directories or DIY guides  
   - Landing page: Native Garden Maintenance service page + relevant service areas

### Supporting Keywords (Use in copy, H2s, FAQs)
- “pollinator garden maintenance Venice / Sarasota”
- “monarch butterfly garden Venice”
- “native plant care service Venice”
