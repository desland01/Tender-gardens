# Native Garden Maintenance Services in Sarasota, Florida

Are you a Sarasota homeowner with a native plant garden that needs expert monthly care? Tender Gardens specializes in native Florida garden maintenance for environmentally conscious residents throughout Sarasota and the surrounding Venice area.

## Why Sarasota Homeowners Choose Native Garden Maintenance

Sarasota's unique coastal ecology and subtropical climate create ideal conditions for native plant gardens - but they require specialized knowledge to maintain properly. Unlike traditional lawn care services, native garden maintenance involves:

- **Distinguishing native volunteers from invasive species** (Brazilian pepper, air potato, tropical milkweed vs. native milkweed)
- **Understanding butterfly and pollinator lifecycles** (when to cut back host plants, seasonal bloom management)
- **Coastal-adapted plant care** (salt tolerance, storm recovery, seasonal moisture needs)
- **Wildlife habitat management** (maintaining cover for birds, nesting sites, continuous bloom for pollinators)

## Our Native Garden Maintenance Services in Sarasota

### Monthly Maintenance Programs
We offer regular monthly or bi-monthly maintenance visits for established native gardens in Sarasota, including:
- Specialized weeding (we know your native volunteer seedlings from invasives)
- Seasonal pruning and deadheading for continuous bloom
- Mulch renewal with organic materials
- Native plant health monitoring and pest management (organic methods only)
- Storm debris cleanup and native plant recovery

### Butterfly Garden Maintenance
Sarasota County has 50-60 butterfly species! Our butterfly garden maintenance ensures your garden supports:
- Monarch butterflies (native milkweed species)
- Gulf Fritillaries (passionflower management)
- Zebra Longwings (proper passionflower care)
- Swallowtails (host plant seasonal care)

### Seasonal Care Schedule for Sarasota Native Gardens
- **Spring (Mar-May)**: New growth management, early bloom season support
- **Summer (Jun-Aug)**: Storm preparation, moisture management, summer blooming species
- **Fall (Sep-Nov)**: Peak planting season, monarch migration support, fall bloom transition
- **Winter (Dec-Feb)**: Snowbird season, winter interest plants, seasonal cleanup

Subject: Referral Partnership Opportunity - Maintenance Specialist

Hi [Owner name - research on their website],

I'm Jaime Goulet with Tender Gardens in Venice. I've been following Florida Native Plants Nursery for years and deeply respect your work promoting native plants and wildlife habitat in our community.

I specialize in native garden MAINTENANCE and would love to explore a referral partnership:

**The Opportunity:**
- You focus on what you do best: retail, design, installation
- I provide ongoing monthly maintenance for your customers' gardens
- We both offer clients a "complete care solution"

**Why This Makes Sense:**
- Many of your installation clients need ongoing maintenance
- I exclusively work with Florida natives (aligned values)
- I'm based in Venice, serving the same Sarasota-area market
- I'd reciprocate by referring clients needing plants/design to your nursery

**My Approach:**
I'm the solo owner on every job, providing personal native garden care for residential clients - a perfect complement to your retail and design services.

Would you be open to a brief call or coffee to discuss? I'd love to learn more about your business and explore how we might support each other.

Best regards,
Jaime Goulet

**Potential Outcome**: The BEST backlink you could get + steady referral stream
