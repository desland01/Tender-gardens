      {
        "question": "Do native plants really require less maintenance?",
        "answer": "Yes! Once established, native Florida plants are adapted to our climate and require significantly less water, no fertilizers, and minimal pest management. However, they do need regular weeding and monitoring, especially in the first year."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long until my butterfly garden attracts butterflies?",
        "answer": "You may see butterflies within days of planting if you include nectar sources. For breeding butterflies, host plants need to be established and healthy - typically 3-6 months for consistent butterfly activity."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will my native garden look messy or weedy?",
        "answer": "Native gardens have a natural, layered look that's different from formal landscapes. With proper maintenance and plant selection, they're beautiful year-round with seasonal interest. I help clients understand and appreciate the natural aesthetic."
      },
      {
        "question": "What areas do you serve?",
