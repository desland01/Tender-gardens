## Implementation Priority and Timeline

### Phase 1 (Month 1): Core Service Pages
1. **Native Garden Maintenance - [Primary City]** (Page 1) - **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
2. **Butterfly Garden Installation - [Primary City]** (Page 2)

These two pages cover your primary service and strongest differentiator. Create these first.

### Phase 2 (Month 2): Expansion
3. **Florida Native Plant Landscaping - [Primary City]** (Page 3)

Captures broader "native landscaping" searches and full installation projects.

### Phase 3 (Month 3): Secondary Market
4. **Native Garden Maintenance - [Secondary City]** (Page 4)

Only create if you have actual service volume in the secondary city. Otherwise, wait until you have 5+ clients there.

### Phase 4 (Month 4): Specialization
5. **Pollinator Garden Service - [Primary or Secondary City]** (Page 5)

Alternative to creating a second city maintenance page. Great for capturing conservation-minded audience.

### SEO Best Practices

**Keyword Density**:
