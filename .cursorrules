# Cursor Global Rules
goals:
  - Mandatory: before any planning or edits, read /Users/thebeast/Downloads/llms-full.txt AND /Users/thebeast/Downloads/astro-agent-primer.txt fully and keep both open as reference; re-read both before writing or modifying any code.
  - Build and maintain an Astro v5 + Tailwind v4 site.
  - Prefer zero/low JS, server-first rendering, Content Layer for content.
  - Keep changes aligned with docs/ASTRO-5.md and docs/TAILWIND-4.md.
defaults:
  style:
    - Be explicit; show file diffs or full files when modifying.
    - Use small, atomic commits with clear messages.
  guardrails:
    - Do not add @astrojs/tailwind. Use @tailwindcss/vite only.
    - Avoid introducing other frameworks unless explicitly requested.
    - Stop if instructions conflict with these rules and open a PR note.
    - No infinite refactors. If stuck, summarize options and stop.
  tools:
    - Use Astro CLI and npm scripts only.
    - If ATLAS_ENABLED=true, follow agents/atlas-notes in agents/.
reviews:
  - Before merge, run: npm run build && npm run preview (manual sanity)
