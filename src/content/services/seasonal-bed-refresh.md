Our crew swaps in seasonal blooms, edges beds, top-dresses with compost, and leaves behind illustrated care cards. We track bloom windows so every change-out feels intentional, not rushed.

**Each visit includes**

- Plant rotation plan staged for three months
- Soil aeration and compost infusions
- Mulch touch-ups with clean edging and sweep
- Targeted pruning to preserve growth habit
- Photo recap and next-steps checklist in your inbox
