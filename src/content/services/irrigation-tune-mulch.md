We audit spray patterns, adjust for new plant heights, and sync schedules to rainfall data. After tuning, we lay down cedar or pine straw with crisp lines and leave hydration gauges so you can monitor with ease.

**Service perks**

- Smart controller programming + rain sensor check
- Drip-line flush and clog inspection
- Mulch delivery, install, and clean sweep finish
- Plant health inspection with quick fixes noted
- Optional add-on: micro-drip install for container gardens
