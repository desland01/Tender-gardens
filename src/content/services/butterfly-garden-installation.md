We focus on intimate butterfly habitat installs, typically 100–400 square feet, that slot into courtyards, front entries, and compact backyards. Jaime handles every step personally: site assessment, quick layout sketch, and plant sourcing from trusted Southwest Florida native nurseries.

**What the build includes**

- Bed prep, invasive removal, and soil amendments sized to the footprint
- Layered planting palettes featuring host plants (milkweed, passionvine, pipevine) and nectar sources timed for Gulf Coast bloom cycles
- Mulch placement and light irrigation tweaks to help roots settle without overspending on water
- Care guide with watering schedule, caterpillar protection tips, and recommended follow-up maintenance cadence

Every install wraps with a printable habitat guide listing each plant’s wildlife role, bloom window, and care notes so you feel confident stewarding the space—or can enroll in our native garden maintenance visits for continued support.
