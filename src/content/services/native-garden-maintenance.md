Native garden maintenance in Venice, FL and Sarasota needs more than standard mowing. Jaime handles on-the-ground care, distinguishing native seedlings from invasives, timing cutbacks around butterfly lifecycles, and keeping coastal beds attractive without sacrificing habitat value. Visits are paced monthly or bi-monthly to fit year-round residents and snowbirds alike.

**Each visit includes**

- Targeted weeding and volunteer identification so milkweed, passionflower, and other hosts stay protected
- Seasonal pruning, deadheading, and thinning tailored to Gulf Coast bloom cycles
- Mulch touch-ups, soil aeration, and compost infusions to manage heat and sand
- Butterfly habitat monitoring with notes on monarch, swallowtail, and zebra longwing activity
- Photo recap, watering reminders, and snowbird-ready next steps emailed after every visit
