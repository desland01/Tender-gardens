We transform underused lawns, hardscapes, or tired beds into regenerating native habitats that stay gorgeous through Gulf Coast weather swings. Jaime starts with soil and sun mapping, drafts a phased planting plan around your lifestyle, and sources every species from trusted Southwest Florida native nurseries.

**What the build includes**

- Site prep, invasive removal, and soil amendments that set roots up for success
- Layered planting palettes featuring keystone natives for butterflies, birds, and pollinators
- Mulch, irrigation tweaks, and microclimate adjustments to reduce maintenance load
- Establishment watering plan plus seasonal check-ins so the garden settles in smoothly
- Optional add-ons: stepping-stone paths, rain garden basins, or container accents crafted with native species

Every install comes with a printable habitat guide listing each plant’s wildlife role, bloom window, and care notes so you feel confident stewarding the space—or hand the reins to our maintenance crew for ongoing care.
