We start with a moodboard walk and soil check, then co-create a phased plan that balances your maintenance capacity with pollinator-forward planting. Deliverables include a hand-illustrated map, plant list with seasonal swaps, and suggested vendor roster.

**What's inside**

- Site walk-through and sun mapping
- Soil test with fertilizer recommendations
- Layered plant palette tailored to color stories and scent cues
- Lighting and irrigation tune-up ideas for effortless evenings
- Aftercare notes + one follow-up call to keep implementation on track
