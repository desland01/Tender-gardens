Venice is home base for Tender Gardens, so Jaime keeps a close eye on the islandâ€™s sandy soils, salty gusts, and seasonal residents. We transform lawns into wildlife-supporting plant communities, refresh lanai planters with pollinator favorites, and steward maintenance plans that stay gorgeous even when clients head north for summer.
