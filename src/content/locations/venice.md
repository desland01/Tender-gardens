Venice is home base for Tender Gardens, so Jaime keeps a close eye on the island’s sandy soils, salty gusts, and seasonal residents. We maintain established native beds, add intimate butterfly garden pockets, refresh lanai planters with pollinator favorites, and steward maintenance plans that stay gorgeous even when clients head north for summer.
