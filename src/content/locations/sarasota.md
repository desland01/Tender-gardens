From Lido Key breezes to Laurel Park shade, Sarasota landscapes thrive when native plant structure meets thoughtful design. Jaime sources every specimen from local nurseries, layers in buttonbush, muhly, and beautyberry for pollinators, and keeps maintenance visits precise so upscale outdoor rooms stay lush without drifting into overgrowth.
