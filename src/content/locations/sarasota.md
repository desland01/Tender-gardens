From Lido Key breezes to Laurel Park shade, Sarasota landscapes thrive when native plant structure meets attentive care. Jaime sources every specimen from local nurseries, layers in buttonbush, muhly, and beautyberry for butterfly gardens, and keeps maintenance visits precise so upscale outdoor rooms stay lush without drifting into overgrowth.
