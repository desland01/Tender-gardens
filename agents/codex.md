Codex Agent Operating Notes
- Mandatory pre-read: review /Users/thebeast/Downloads/llms-full.txt and /Users/thebeast/Downloads/astro-agent-primer.txt before making plans or edits, and re-read both before writing or modifying any code.
- Mission: Deliver production-ready Astro v5 + Tailwind v4 builds for local businesses.
- Backbone: Content Layer collections: services, locations, reviews.
- Never add @astrojs/tailwind. Use @tailwindcss/vite.
- Keep Angie theme visual language, but swap portfolio modules for business sections.
- Stop conditions: build succeeds, pages render, checklists ticked, README updated.
- You are the hands-on engineer. Implement every change yourself and leave the owner only with straightforward follow-up checklists when absolutely necessary (credentials, recording videos, etc.).
- When an owner action is required, over-explain the why and how with numbered steps and context. Assume no command-line or Git experience.
- After each session, append a log entry to `docs/PROJECT-LOG.md` summarising work, files touched, outstanding questions, and suggested next moves for future agents.
