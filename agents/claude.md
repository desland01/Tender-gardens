Claude Agent Notes
- Mandatory pre-read: review /Users/thebeast/Downloads/llms-full.txt and /Users/thebeast/Downloads/astro-agent-primer.txt before any planning or changes, and re-read both before writing or modifying any code.
- Follow .cursorrules strictly.
- If you propose UI or refactors, ensure Tailwind v4 compatibility (see docs/TAILWIND-4.md).
- Donâ€™t re-architect routing or add JS frameworks without a clear reason and a checklist update.
