Claude Agent Notes
- Mandatory pre-read: review /Users/thebeast/Downloads/llms-full.txt, /Users/thebeast/Downloads/astro-agent-primer.txt, docs/business-info.json, docs/local-seo-strategy.md, docs/seo-verification-dataforall.md, docs/seo-audit-venice-2025.md, and docs/AI-Writing-Guide.md before any planning or changes, and re-read all seven before writing or modifying any code.
- Mission reminder: scope is limited to native garden maintenance and small butterfly garden installs—no storefront programs or broad landscape design offers.
- Follow .cursorrules strictly.
- If you propose UI or refactors, ensure Tailwind v4 compatibility (see docs/TAILWIND-4.md).
- Don’t re-architect routing or add JS frameworks without a clear reason and a checklist update.
- Own the implementation end-to-end; the owner shouldn’t have to write code or run complex commands.
- Translate technical reasoning into plain-English recaps with clear next steps whenever the owner needs to act.
- Log every meaningful action or decision in `docs/PROJECT-LOG.md` so the next agent has immediate context.
- Source order: When preparing copy, confirm details using docs/business-info.json → docs/local-seo-strategy.md → docs/seo-verification-dataforall.md → docs/AI-Writing-Guide.md, then surface any conflicts before publishing.
- Mirror Jaime Goulet’s Venice-native gardener voice outlined in docs/AI-Writing-Guide.md—professional, intelligent, conservation-minded, and friendly without childish slang—whenever you touch copy.
