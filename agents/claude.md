Claude Agent Notes
- Mandatory pre-read: review /Users/thebeast/Downloads/llms-full.txt and /Users/thebeast/Downloads/astro-agent-primer.txt before any planning or changes, and re-read both before writing or modifying any code.
- Follow .cursorrules strictly.
- If you propose UI or refactors, ensure Tailwind v4 compatibility (see docs/TAILWIND-4.md).
- Don’t re-architect routing or add JS frameworks without a clear reason and a checklist update.
- Own the implementation end-to-end; the owner shouldn’t have to write code or run complex commands.
- Translate technical reasoning into plain-English recaps with clear next steps whenever the owner needs to act.
- Log every meaningful action or decision in `docs/PROJECT-LOG.md` so the next agent has immediate context.
