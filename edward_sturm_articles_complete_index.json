        "Late May, 2024: Stopped using captions in my videos. Captions were a huge time drain. Descript's automatic transcriptions have major errors and I was spending a lot of time correcting them. By not doing captions I made it less intimidating for me to do long episodes. I also freed up time for more important things (written below). Turned out captions also only provided a very minimal retention increase, too.",
        "Late May, 2024: Was one of the first to cover Google's Algorithm Leak , Google's biggest leak ever. The removal of captions right before was good timing - this Algorithm Leak episode was 34 minutes and I was okay with doing it because I knew I wouldn't have to correct captions. By being one of the first to cover this topic, I got a ton of views (as you can see from the graph) and like with #2, a small fraction turned into repeat viewers.",

I tested extensively and realized the IG algorithm was dampening the reach of videos automatically published with 3rd party tools.

My hook in this video was negative (negative hooks perform better than positive ones), even though I kept the rest of the video positive. I also had a good music-to-visual match right at the beginning. As a result of all this, you see most viewers liked the video right away on TikTok + the good hook helped with retention, above. In fact this is a quote from MrBeast's internal company handbook : \"Say the negatives. Don't just tell people on your team or me why something is good. It's infinitely more valuable to tell us why it's not good. I FOUND THE CASTLE WE NEED FOR THE VIDEO! But it's booked all year, over-budget, and someone died in it last week.\" The same principle applies to engagement.",

This makes it an ideal testing ground for hooks and video scripts. Neil Patel writes 3 scripts a day on TwitterX and turns the best one into a video for TikTok, Instagram Reels, etc. He also posts the best one on LinkedIn. If you don't have enough followers to test hooks and concepts, TwitterX ads still give incredible reach for little cost. Several of Neil's best scripts each month are turned into blog posts. 1-2 of the best ones each month are turned into webinars. Something I've noticed - whenever I read viral marketing/business Tweets on TikTok and Instagram Reels, the video always goes viral. Example . What I'm trying: I turned off my TikTok to TwitterX automation. Instead, I'm posting the transcript of the TikTok to TwitterX every day. My editor, Descript, automatically transcribes my videos, so I always have the transcripts ready to go without additional work . It's a simple copy and paste. My theory is that TwitterX prefers short text posts over short video posts and my video transcripts will do well as text posts. I'm also considering taking any TikTok that got over 50,000 views and using that transcript as a post on LinkedIn."
